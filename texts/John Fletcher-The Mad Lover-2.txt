  _Lucip._ Ladie.                                        [_She Swounds._

  _C[l]e._ O royal Madam, Gentlemen for heaven sake.            { _They
                                                                { come
  _Pol._ Give her fresh air, she comes again: away sirs         { back._
  And here stand close till we perceive the working.

  _Eumen._ Ye have undone all.

  _Pol._ So I fear.

  _2 Capt._ She loves ye.

  _Eumen._ And then all hopes lost this way.

  _Pol._ Peace she rises.

  _Clean._ Now for my purpose Fortune.

  _Calis._ Where's the Gentleman?

  _Lucip._ Gone Madam.

  _Calis._ Why gone?

  _Lucip._ H'as dispatch't his business.

  _Calis._ He came to speak with me,
  He did.

  _Clean._ He did not.

  _Calis._ For I had many questions.

  _Lucip._ On my Faith Madam, he
  Talk't a great while to ye.

  _Calis._ Thou conceiv'st not,
  He talk't not as he should doe; O my heart
  Away with that sad sight; didst thou e're love me?

  _Lucip._ Why do you make that question?

  _Calis._ If thou didst
  Run, run wench, run: nay see how thou stir'st.

  _Lucip._ Whither?

  _Calis._ If 'twere for any thing to please thy self
  Thou woud'st run toth' devil: but I am grown--

  _Clean._ Fie Lady.

  _Cal._ I ask none of your fortunes, nor your loves,
  None of your bent desires I slack, ye are not
  In love with all men, are ye? one for shame
  You will leave your honour'd mistris? why do ye stare so?
  What is that ye see about me, tell me?
  Lord what am I become? I am not wilde sure,
  Heaven keep that from me: O _Cleanthe_ help me,
  Or I am sunk to death.

  _Cle._ Ye have offended and mightily, love is incenst against ye,
  And therefore take my Counsel, to the Temple,
  For that's the speediest physick: before the Goddess
  Give your repentant prayers: ask her will,
  And from the Oracle attend your sentence,
  She is milde and mercifull.

  _Calis._ I will: O _Venus_
  Even as thou lov'st thy self!

  _Clean._ Now for my fortune.               [_Exeunt_ Cal. _and women_.

  _Pol._ What shall I doe?

  _1 Capt._ Why make your self.

  _Pol._ I dare not,
  No Gentlemen, I dare not be a villain,
  Though her bright beauty would entice an Angel.
  I will toth' King my last hope: get him a woman
  As we before concluded: and as ye pass
  Give out the Spartans are in arms; and terrible;
  And let some letters to that end be feign'd too
  And sent to you, some Posts too, to the General;
  And let me work: be ne're him still.

  _Eumen._ We will Sir.

  _Pol._ Farewel: and pray for all: what e're I will ye
  Doe it, and hope a fair end.

  _Eumen._ The Gods speed ye.                                 [_Exeunt_.

        _Enter_ Stremon, _Fool, Boy, and Servants_.

  _Servants._ He lies quiet.

  _Strem._ Let him lye, and as I told ye
  Make ready for this shew: h'as divers times
  Been calling upon _Orpheus_ to appear
  And shew the joyes: now I will be that _Orpheus_,
  And as I play and sing, like beasts and trees
  I wou'd have you shap't and enter: thou a Dog, fool,
  I have sent about your sutes: the Boy a bush,
  An Ass you, you a Lion.

  _Fool._ I a Dog?
  I'le fit you for a Dog. Bow wow.

  _Strem._ 'Tis excellent,
  Steal in and make no noise.

  _Fool._ Bow wow.

  _Strem._ Away Rogue.                                        [_Exeunt_.

        _Enter Priestess, and_ Chilax.

  _Priest._ Good sweet friend be not long.

  _Chi._ Thou think'st each hour ten
  Till I be ferreting.

  _Prie._ You know I love ye.

  _Chi._ I will not be above an hour; let thy robe be readie
  And the door be kept.                              { _Knock._ Cleanthe
                                                     { _knocks within_.
  _Prie._ Who knocks there?
  Yet more business?

        _Enter_ Cleanthe.

  _Chi._ Have ye more pensioners? the Princess woman?
  Nay then I'le stay a little, what game's a foot now?

  _Clean._ Now is the time.

  _Chi._ A rank bawd by this hand too,
  She grinds o' both sides: hey boyes.

  _Priest._ How, your Brother _Siphax_?
  Loves he the Princess?

  _Cle._ Deadlie, and you know
  He is a Gentleman descended noblie.

  _Chi._ But a rank knave as ever pist.

  _Cle._ Hold Mother,
  Here's more gold and some jewells.

  _Chi._ Here's no villany,
  I am glad I came toth' hearing.

  _Priest._ Alas Daughter,
  What would ye have me doe?

  _Chi._ Hold off ye old whore;
  There's more gold coming; all's mine, all.

  _Cle._ Do ye shrink now,
  Did ye not promise faithfully, and told me
  Through any danger?

  _Pri._ Any I can wade through.

  _Cle._ Ye shall and easily, the sin not seen neither,
  Here's for a better stole and a new vail mother:
  Come, ye shall be my friend.

  _Chi._ If all hit, hang me,
  I'le make ye richer than the Goddess.

  _Pri._ Say then,
  I am yours, what must I doe?

  _Cle._ I'th' morning
  But very early, will the Princess visit
  The Temple of the Goddess, being troubled
  With strange things that distract her: from the Oracle
  (Being strongly too in love) she will demand
  The Goddess pleasure, and a Man to cure her,
  That Oracle you give: describe my Brother,
  You know him perfectly.

  _Pri._ I have seen him often.

  _Cle._ And charge her take the next man she shall meet with
  When she comes out: you understand me.

  _Priest._ Well.

  _Cle._ Which shall be he attending; this is all,
  And easily without suspicion ended,
  Nor none dare disobey, 'tis Heaven that does it,
  And who dares cross it then, or once suspect it?
  The venture is most easie.

  _Pri._ I will doe it.

  _Cle._ As ye shall prosper?

  _Pri._ As I shall prosper.

  _Cle._ Take this too, and farewel; but first hark hither.

  _Chi._ What a young whore's this to betray her Mistris?
  A thousand Cuckolds shall that Husband be,
  That marries thee, thou art so mischievous.
  I'le put a spoak among your wheels.

  _Clean._ Be constant.

  _Priest._ 'Tis done.

  _Chi._ I'le doe no more at drop shot then.             [_Exit_ Chilax.

  _Pri._ Farewel wench.                   [_Exeunt Priest and_ Cleanthe.




_Actus Quartus. Scena Prima._


        _Enter a Servant, and_ Stremon, _at the door_.

  _Servant._ He stirs, he stirs.

  _Strem._ Let him, I am ready for him,
  He shall not this day perish, if his passions
  May be fed with Musick; are they ready?

        _Enter_ Memnon.

  _Ser._ All, all: see where he comes.

  _Strem._ I'le be straight for him.                    [_Exit_ Stremon.

        _Enter_ Eumenes, _and Captains_.

  _Ser._ How sad he looks and sullen!                    [_Stand close._
  Here are the Captains: my fear's past now.

  _Mem._ Put case i'th' other world
  She do not love me neither? I am old 'tis certain.

  _Eumen._ His spirit is a little quieter.

  _Mem._ My blood lost, and limbs stiff; my embraces
  Like the cold stubborn bark, hoarie, and heatless,
  My words worse: my fame only and atchievements
  Which are my strength, my blood, my youth, my fashion,
  Must wooe her, win her, wed her; that's but wind,
  And women are not brought to bed with shadows:
  I do her wrong, much wrong; she is young and blessed,
  Sweet as the spring, and as his blossoms tender,
  And I a nipping North-wind, my head hung
  With hails, and frostie Isicles: are the souls so too
  When they depart hence, lame and old, and loveless?
  No sure, 'tis ever youth there; Time and Death
  Follow our flesh no more: and that forc'd opinion
  That spirits have no sexes, I believe not.

        _Enter_ Stremon, _like_ Orpheus.

  There must be love, there is love: what art thou?

  SONG.

        Stre. _Orpheus I am, come from the deeps below,_
        _To thee fond man the plagues of love to show:_
        _To the fair fields where loves eternal dwell_
        _There's none that come, but first they pass through hell:_
          _Hark and beware unless thou hast lov'd ever,_
          _Belov'd again, thou shalt see those joyes never._

        _Hark how they groan that dy'd despairing,_
          _O take heed then:_
        _Hark how they howl for over-daring,_
          _All these were men._

        _They that be fools, and dye for fame_
          _They lose their name;_
        _And they that bleed_
          _Hark how they speed._

        _Now in cold frosts, now scorching fires_
        _They sit, and curse their lost desires:_
        _Nor shall these souls be free from pains and fears,_
        _Till Women waft them over in their tears._

  _Mem._ How should I know my passage is deni'd me?
  Or which of all the Devils dare?

  _Eumen._ This Song
  Was rarely form'd to fit him.

  SONG.

        Orph. _Charon O Charon,_
        _Thou wafter of the souls to bliss or bane._

        Cha. _Who calls the Ferry-man of Hell?_

        Orph. _Come near,_
        _And say who lives in joy, and who in fear._

        Cha. _Those that dye well, Eternal joy shall follow;_
        _Those that dye ill, their own foul fate shall swallow._

        Orph. _Shall thy black Bark those guilty spirits stow_
        _That kill themselves for love?_

        Cha. _O no, no,_
        _My cordage cracks when such great sins are near,_
        _No wind blows fair, nor I myself can stear._

        Orph. _What lovers pass and in Elyzium raign?_

        Cha. _Those Gentle loves that are belov'd again._

        Orph. _This Souldier loves, and fain wou'd dye to win,_
        _Shall he goe on?_

        Cha. _No 'tis too foul a sin._
        _He must not come aboard: I dare not row,_
        _Storms of despair, and guilty blood will blow._

        Orph. _Shall time release him, say?_

        Cha. _No, no, no, no._
        _Nor time nor death can alter us, nor prayer;_
        _My boat is destinie, and who then dare_
        _But those appointed come aboard? Live still,_
        _And love by reason, Mortal, not by will._

        Orph. _And when thy Mistris shall close up thine eyes,_

        Cha. _Then come aboard and pass,_

        Orph. _Till when be wise._

        Cha. _Till when be wise._

  _Eumen._ How still he sits: I hope this Song has setled him.

  _1 Capt._ He bites his lip, and rowles his fiery eyes, yet
  I fear for all this--

  _2 Capt._ _Stremon_ still apply to him.

  _Strem._ Give me more room, sweetly strike, divinely
  Such strains as old earth moves at.

  _Orph._ The power I have over both beast and plant,
  Thou man alone feelst miserable want.                       [_Musick._
  Strike you rare Spirits that attend my will,
  And lose your savage wildness by my skill.

        _Enter a_ Mask _of_ Beasts.

  This Lion was a man of War that died,
  As thou wouldst do, to gild his Ladies pride:
  This Dog a fool that hung himself for love:
  This Ape with daily hugging of a glove,
  Forgot to eat and died. This goodly tree,
  An usher that still grew before his Ladie,
  Wither'd at root. This, for he could not wooe,
  A grumbling Lawyer: this pyed Bird a page,
  That melted out because he wanted age.
  Still these lye howling on the Stygian shore,
  O love no more, O love no more.                        [_Exit_ Memnon.

  _Eumen._ He steals off silently, as though he would sleep,
  No more, but all be near him, feed his fancie
  Good _Stremon_ still; this may lock up his follie.
  Yet Heaven knows I much fear him; away softly.     [_Exeunt Captains._

  _Fool._ Did I not doe most doggedly?

  _Strem._ Most rarelie.

  _Fool._ He's a brave man, when shall we dog again?

  _Boy._ Unty me first for Gods sake,

  _Fool._ Help the Boy; he's in a wood poor child: good hony _Stremon_
  Let's have a bear-baiting; ye shall see me play
  The rarest for a single Dog: at head all;
  And if I do not win immortal glorie,
  Play Dog play Devil.

  _Strem._ Peace for this time.

  _Fool._ Prethee
  Let's sing him a black Santis, then let's all howl
  In our own beastly voices; tree keep your time,
  Untye there; bow, wow, wow.

  _Strem._ Away ye Asse, away.

  _Fool._ Why let us doe something
  To satisfie the Gentleman, he's mad;
  A Gentleman-like humour, and in fashion,
  And must have men as mad about him.

  _Strem._ Peace,
  And come in quicklie, 'tis ten to one else
  He'l find a staff to beat a dog; no more words,
  I'le get ye all imployment; soft, soft in all.              [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Chilax _and_ Cloe.

  _Chi._ When camest thou over wench?

  _Clo._ But now this evening,
  And have been ever since looking out _Siphax_,
  I'th' wars he would have lookt me: sure h'as gotten
  Some other Mistris?

  _Chi._ A thousand, wench, a thousand,
  They are as common here as Caterpillers
  Among the corn, they eat up all the Souldiers.

  _Clo._ Are they so hungry? yet by their leave _[C]hilax_,
  I'le have a snatch too.

  _Chi._ Dost thou love him still wench?

  _Clo._ Why should I not? he had my Maiden-head
  And all my youth.

  _Chi._ Thou art come the happiest,
  In the most blessed time, sweet wench the fittest,
  If thou darst make thy fortune: by this light, _Cloe_,
  And so I'le kiss thee: and if thou wilt but let me,
  For 'tis well worth a kindness.

  _Clo._ What shou'd I let ye?

  _Chi._ Enjoy thy miniken.

  _Clo._ Thou art still old _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ Still still, and ever shall be: if, I say,
  Thou wo't strike the stroke: I cannot do much harm wench.

  _Clo._ Nor much good.

  _Chi._ _Siphax_ shall be thy Husband,
  Thy very Husband woman, thy fool, thy Cuckold,
  Or what thou wilt make him: I am over joy'd,
  Ravisht, clean ravisht with this fortune; kiss me,
  Or I shall lose my self.

  _Clo._ My Husband said ye?

  _Chi._ Said I? and will say, _Cloe_: nay and do it
  And do it home too; Peg thee as close to him
  As birds are with a pin to one another;
  I have it, I can do it: thou wantst clothes too,
  And hee'l be hang'd unless he marry thee
  E're he maintain thee: now he has Ladies, Courtiers
  More than his back can bend at, multitudes;
  We are taken up for threshers, will ye bite?

  _Clo._ Yes.

  _Chi._ And let me--

  _Clo._ Yes and let ye--

  _Chi._ What!

  _Clo._ Why that ye wote of.

  _Chi._ I cannot stay, take your instructions
  And something toward houshold, come, what ever
  I shall advise ye, follow it exactlie,
  And keep your times I point ye; for I'le tell ye
  A strange way you must wade through.

  _Clo._ Fear not me Sir.

  _Chi._ Come then, and let's dispatch this modicum,
  For I have but an hour to stay, a short one,
  Besides more water for another mill,
  An old weak over-shot I must provide for,
  There's an old Nunnerie at hand.

  _Clo._ What's that?

  _Chi._ A bawdie house.

  _Clo._ A pox consume it.

  _Chi._ If the stones 'tis built on
  Were but as brittle as the flesh lives in it,
  Your curse came handsomlie: fear not, there's ladies,
  And other good sad people: your pinkt Citizens
  Think it no shame to shake a sheet there: Come wench.       [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Cleanthe _and_ Siphax.

  _Clean._ A Souldier and so fearfull?

  _Siph._ Can ye blame me;
  When such a weight lies on me?

  _Clean._ Fye upon ye,
  I tell ye, ye shall have her: have her safelie,
  And for your wife with her own will.

  _Siph._ Good Sister--

  _Cle._ What a distrustfull man are you! to morrow,
  To morrow morning--

  _Siph._ Is it possible?
  Can there be such a happiness?

  _Clean._ Why hang me
  If then ye be not married: if to morrow night,
  Ye doe not--

  _Siph._ O dear Sister--

  _Clean._ What ye wou'd doe,
  What ye desire to doe; lie with her: Devil,
  What a dull man are you!

  _Siph._ Nay I believe now,
  And shall she love me?

  _Clean._ As her life, and stroke ye.

  _Siph._ O I will be her Servant.

  _Clean._ 'Tis your dutie.

  _Siph._ And she shall have her whole will.

  _Clean._ Yes 'tis reason,
  She is a Princess, and by that rule boundless.

  _Si._ What wou'd you be? for I wou'd have ye Sister
  Chuse some great place about us: as her woman
  Is not so fit.

  _Clean._ No, no, I shall find places.

  _Siph._ And yet to be a Ladie of her bed-chamber,
  I hold not so fit neither,
  Some great title, believe it, shall be look't out.

  _Clean._ Ye may, a Dutchess
  Or such a toye, a small thing pleases me Sir.

  _Sip._ What you will Sister: if a neighbour Prince,
  When we shall come to raign--

  _Clean._ We shall think on't,
  Be ready at the time, and in that place too,
  And let me work the rest, within this half hour
  The Princess will be going, 'tis almost morning,
  Away and mind your business.

  _Siph._ Fortune bless us.                                   [_Exeunt._

        _Enter King_, Polydor _and Lords_.

  _Pol._ I do beseech your grace to banish me.

  _King._ Why Gentleman, is she not worthy marriage?

  _Pol._ Most worthy, Sir, where worth again shall meet her,
  But I like thick clouds sailing slow and heavy,
  Although by her drawn higher, yet shall hide her,
  I dare not be a traitor; and 'tis treason,
  But to imagine: as you love your honour--

  _King._ 'Tis her first maiden doting, and if crost,
  I know it kills her.

  _1 Lord._ How knows your grace she loves him?

  _King._ Her woman told me all (beside his story)
  Her maid _Lucippe_, on what reason too,
  And 'tis beyond all but enjoying.

  _Polydor._ Sir,
  Even by your wisdom; by that great discretion
  Ye owe to rule and order--

  _2 Lord._ This man's mad sure,
  To plead against his fortune--

  _1 Lord._ And the King too,
  Willing to have it so!

  _Pol._ By those dead Princes
  From whose descents ye stand a star admir'd at,
  Lay not so base a lay upon your vertues;
  Take heed, for honours sake take heed: the bramble
  No wise man ever planted by the rose,
  It cankers all her beauty; nor the vine
  When her full blushes court the sun, dares any
  Choke up with wanton Ivy: good my Lords,
  Who builds a monument, the Basis Jasper,
  And the main body Brick?

  _2 Lord._ Ye wrong your worth,
  Ye are a Gentleman descended nobly.

  _1 Lord._ In both bloods truly noble.

  _King._ Say ye were not,
  My will can make ye so.

  _Pol._ No, never, never;
  'Tis not descent, nor will of Princes does it,
  'Tis Vertue which I want, 'tis Temperance,
  Man, honest man: is't fit your Majesty
  Should call my drunkenness, my rashness, Brother?
  Or such a blessed Maid my breach of faith,
  (For I am most lascivious) and fell angers
  In which I am also mischievous, her Husband?
  O Gods preserve her! I am wild as Winter,
  Ambitious as the Devil: out upon me,
  I hate my self, Sir, if ye dare bestow her
  Upon a Subject, ye have one deserves her.

  _King._ But him she does not love: I know your meaning.
  This young mans love unto his noble Brother
  Appears a mirrour; what must now be done Lords?
  For I am gravel'd, if she have not him,
  She dies for certain, if his Brother miss her,
  Farewel to him, and all our honours.

  _1 Lord._ He is dead, Sir,
  Your Grace has heard of that, and strangely.

  _King._ No,
  I can assure you no, there was a trick in't,
  Read that, and then know all; what ails the Gentleman?
  Hold him; how do ye Sir?              [Polydor _is sick o'th' sudden_.

  _Pol._ Sick o'th' sudden,
  Extreamly ill, wondrous ill.

  _King._ Where did it take ye?

  _Pol._ Here in my head, Sir, and my heart, for Heaven sake.

  _King._ Conduct him to his Chamber presently,
  And bid my Doctors--

  _Pol._ No, I shall be well, Sir,
  I do beseech your Grace, even for the Gods sake
  Remember my poor Brother, I shall pray then.

  _King._ Away, he grows more weak still: I will do it,
  Or Heaven forget me ever. Now your Counsels,               [_Ex._ Pol.
  For I am at my wits end; what with you Sir?

        _Enter_ Messenger _with a Letter_.

  _Mess._ Letters from warlike _Pelius_.

  _King._ Yet more troubles?
  The _Spartans_ are in Arms, and like to win all:
  Supplies are sent for, and the General;
  This is more cross than t'other; come let's to him,
  For he must have her, 'tis necessity,
  Or we must lose our honours, let's plead all,
  For more than all is needful, shew all reason
  If love can hear o' that side, if she yield
  We have fought best, and won the noblest field.             [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Eumenes, _Captains_, Stremon.

  _1 Cap._ I have brought the wench, a lusty wench,
  And somewhat like the Princess.

  _Eumen._ 'Tis the better, let's see her,
  And go you in and tell him, that her Grace
  Is come to visit him: how sleeps he _Stremon_?

  _Stre._ He cannot, only thinks, and calls on _Polydor_,
  Swears he will not be fool'd; sometimes he rages,
  And sometimes sits and muses.                         [_Exit_ Stremon.

        _Enter_ Whore, _and_ Captain.

  _Eume._ He's past all help sure?
  How do ye like her?

  _2 Capt._ By th' mass a good round Virgin,
  And at first sight resembling, she is well cloath'd too.

  _Eume._ But is she sound?

  _2 Cap._ Of wind and limb, I warrant her.

  _Eume._ You are instructed Lady?

  _Who._ Yes, and know, Sir,
  How to behave my self, ne're fear.

  _Eume._ _Polybius_,
  Where did he get this Vermin?

  _1 Capt._ Hang him Badger,
  There's not a hole free from him, whores and whores mates
  Do all pay him obedience.

  _Eume._ Indeed i'th' War,
  His quarter was all Whore, Whore upon Whore,
  And lin'd with Whore; beshrew me 'tis a fair Whore.

  _1 Capt._ She has smockt away her blood; but fair or foul,
  Or blind or lame, that can but lift her leg up,
  Comes not amiss to him, he rides like a night Mare,
  All Ages, all Religions.

  _Eume._ Can ye state it?

  _Who._ I'le make a shift.

  _Eume._ He must lie with ye, Lady.

  _Who._ Let him, [h]e's not the first man I have lain with,
  Nor shall not be the last.

        _Enter_ Memnon.

  _2 Capt._ He comes, no more words,
  She has her lesson throughly; how he views her!

  _Eumen._ Go forward now, so, bravely, stand!

  _Mem._ Great Lady,
  How humbly I am bound--

  _Who._ You shall not kneel, Sir,
  Come, I have done you wrong; stand my Souldier,
  And thus I make amends--                                [_Kisses him._

  _Eumen._ A Plague confound ye,
  Is this your state?

  _2 Capt._ 'Tis well enough.

  _Mem._ O Lady,
  Your Royal hand, your hand my dearest beauty
  Is more than I must purchase: here divine one,
  I dare revenge my wrongs: ha?

  _1 Capt._ A damn'd foul one.

  _Eume._ The Lees of Baudy prewns: mourning Gloves?
  All spoil'd by Heaven.

  _Mem._ Ha! who art thou?

  _2 Capt._ A shame on ye,
  Ye clawing scabby Whore.

  _Mem._ I say, who art thou?

  _Eumen._ Why 'tis the Princess, Sir.

  _Mem._ The Devil, Sir,
  'Tis some Roguey thing.

  _Who._ If this abuse be love, Sir,
  Or I that laid aside my modesty--

  _Eumen._ So far thou't never find it.

  _Mem._ Do not weep,
  For if ye be the Princess, I will love ye,
  Indeed I will, and honour ye, fight for ye,
  Come, wipe your eyes; by Heaven she stinks; who art thou?
  Stinks like a poyson'd Rat behind a hanging?
  Woman, who art? like a rotten Cabbage.

  _2 Capt._ Y'are much to blame, Sir, 'tis the Princess.

  _Mem._ How?
  She the Princess?

  _Eumen._ And the loving Princess.

  _1 Capt._ Indeed the doating Princess.

  _Mem._ Come hither once more,
  The Princess smells like mornings breath, pure Amber,
  Beyond the courted _Indies_ in her spices.
  Still a dead Rat by Heaven; thou a Princess?

  _Eumen._ What a dull Whore is this!

  _Mem._ I'le tell ye presently,
  For if she be a Princess, as she may be
  And yet stink too, and strongly, I shall find her;
  Fetch the _Numidian_ Lyon I brought over,
  If she be sprung from the Royal blood, the Lyon,
  He'l do you reverence, else--

  _Who._ I beseech your Lordship--

  _Eumen._ He'l tear her all to pieces.

  _Who._ I am no Princess, Sir.

  _Mem._ Who brought thee hither?

  _2 Capt._ If ye confess, we'll hang ye.

  _Who._ Good my Lord--

  _Mem._ Who art thou then?

  _Who._ A poor retaining Whore, Sir,
  To one of your Lordships Captains.

  _Mem._ Alas poor Whore,
  Go, be a Whore still, and stink worse: _Ha, ha, ha_.      [_Ex._ Cloe.
  What fools are these, and Coxcombs!                    [_Exit_ Memnon.

  _Eumen._ I am right glad yet,
  He takes it with such lightness.

  _1 Cap._ Me thinks his face too
  Is not so clouded as it was; how he looks!

  _Eume._ Where's your dead Rat?

  _2 Cap._ The Devil dine upon her
  Loins; why what a Medicine had he gotten
  To try a Whore!

        _Enter_ Stremon.

  _Stre._ Here's one from _Polydor_ stays to speak with ye.

  _Eume._ With whom?

  _Stre._ With all; where has the General been?
  He's laughing to himself extreamly.

  _Eumen._ Come,
  I'le tell thee how; I am glad yet he's so merry.            [_Exeunt._




_Actus Quintus. Scena Prima._


        _Enter_ Chilax _and Priestess_, Calis, _Lady and Nun_.

  _Chi._ What lights are those that enter there, still nearer?
  Plague o' your rotten itch, do you draw me hither
  Into the Temple to betray me? was there no place
  To satisfie your sin in? Gods forgive me,
  Still they come forward.

  _Priest._ Peace ye fool, I have found it,
  'Tis the young Princess _Calis_.

  _Chi._ 'Tis the Devil,
  To claw us for our catterwawling.

  _Priest._ Retire softly,
  I did not look for you these two hours, Lady,
  Beshrew your hast: that way.                             [_To_ Chilax.

  _Chi._ That goes to the Altar!
  Ye old blind Beast.

  _Priest._ I know not, any way;
  Still they come nearer,
  I'le in to th' Oracle.

  _Chi._ That's well remembred I'le in with ye.

  _Priest._ Do.                            [_Exeunt Priest, and_ Chilax.

        _Enter_ Calis _and her Train with lights, singing:_
        Lucippe, Cleanthe.

  SONG.

        _O fair sweet Goddess Queen of Loves,_
        _Soft and gentle, as thy Doves,_
        _Humble ey'd, and ever ruing_
        _Those poor hearts, their Loves pursuing:_
        _O thou Mother of delights,_
        _Crowner of all happy nights,_
        _Star of dear content, and pleasure,_
        _Of mutual loves the endless treasure,_
        _Accept this sacrifice we bring,_
        _Thou continual youth and Spring,_
        _Grant this Lady her desires,_
        _And every hour we'll crown thy fires._

                Enter a Nun.

        Nun. _You about her all retire,_
        _Whilest the Princess feeds the fire,_
        _When your Devotions ended be_
        _To the Oracle I will attend ye._

                     [_Exit_ Nun and draws the Curtain close to _Calis_.

        _Enter_ Stremon _and_ Eumenes.

  _Strem._ He will abroad.

  _Eumen._ How does his humour hold him?

  _Stre._ He is now grown wondrous sad, weeps often too,
  Talks of his Brother to himself, starts strangely.

  _Eumen._ Does he not curse?

  _Strem._ No.

  _Eumen._ Nor break out in fury,
  Offering some new attempt?

  _Strem._ Neither; to th' Temple
  Is all we hear of now: what there he will do--

  _Eumen._ I hope repent his folly, let's be near him.

  _Strem._ Where are the rest?

  _Eumen._ About a business
  Concerns him mainly, if Heav'n cure his madness,
  He's made for ever, _Stremon_.

  _Strem._ Does the King know it?

  _Eumen._ Yes, and much troubled with it, he's now gone
  To seek his Sister out.

  _Strem._ Come let's away then.            [_Exeunt_ Eumen. Strem. Cal.

      _Enter Nun, she opens the Curtain to_ Calis.
      Calis _at the Oracle._

  _Nun._ Peace to your Prayers Lady, will it please ye
  To pass on to the Oracle?

  _Cal._ Most humbly.               [Chilax _and Priest, in the Oracle_.

  _Chi._ Do ye hear that?

  _Priest._ Yes, lie close.

  _Chi._ A wildfire take ye,
  What shall become of me? I shall be hang'd now:
  Is this a time to shake? a halter shake ye,
  Come up and juggle, come.

  _Priest._ I am monstrous fearful.

  _Chi._ Up ye old gaping Oyster, up and answer;
  A mouldy Mange upon your chops, ye told me
  I was safe here till the Bell rung.

  _Priest._ I was prevented,
  And did not look these three hours for the Princess.

  _Chi._ Shall we be taken?

  _Priest._ Speak for loves sake, _Chilax_;
  I cannot, nor I dare not.

  _Chi._ I'le speak Treason, for I had as lieve be hang'd for that.

  _Priest._ Good _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ Must it be sung or said? what shall I tell 'em?
  They are here; here now preparing.

  _Priest._ O my Conscience!

  _Chi._ Plague o' your spurgall'd Conscience, does it tire now?
  Now when it should be tuffest? I could make thee--

  _Priest._ Save us, we are both undone else.

  _Chi._ Down ye Dog then,
  Be quiet, and be stanch to no inundations.

  _Nun._ Here kneel again, and _Venus_ grant your wishes.

        Calis. _O Divine Star of Heaven,_
        _Thou in power above the seven:_
        _Thou sweet kindler of desires,_
        _Till they grow to mutual fires:_
        _Thou, O gentle Queen, that art_
        _Curer of each wounded heart:_
        _Thou the fuel, and the flame;_
        _Thou in Heaven, and here the same:_
        _Thou the wooer, and the woo'd:_
        _Thou the hunger, and the food:_
        _Thou the prayer, and the pray'd;_
        _Thou what is, or shall be said:_
        _Thou still young, and golden tressed,_
        _Make me by thy Answer blessed._

  _Chi._ When?

  _Priest._ Now speak handsomly, and small by all means,
  I have told ye what.                                       [_Thunder._

  _Chi._ But I'le tell you a new tale,
  Now for my Neck-verse; I have heard thy prayers,
  And mark me well.

        _Musick._ Venus _descends_.

  _Nun._ The Goddess is displeased much,
  The temple shakes and totters; she appears,
  Bow, Lady, bow.

        Venus. _Purge me the Temple round,_
        _And live by this example henceforth sound._
        _Virgin, I have seen thy tears,_
        _Heard thy wishes, and thy fears;_
        _Thy holy Incense flew above,_
        _Hark therefore to thy doom in Love;_
        _Had thy heart been soft at first,_
        _Now thou had'st allay'd thy thirst,_
        _Had thy stubborn will but bended,_
        _All thy sorrows here had ended;_
        _Therefore to be just in Love,_
        _A strange Fortune thou must prove,_
        _And, for thou hast been stern and coy,_
        _A dead Love thou shalt enjoy._

  _Cal._ O gentle goddess!

  _Ven._ Rise, thy doom is said,
  And fear not, I will please thee with the dead.      [Venus _ascends_.

  _Nun._ Go up into the Temple and there end
  Your holy Rites, the Goddess smiles upon ye. [_Exeunt_ Cal. _and_ Nun.

        _Enter_ Chilax _in his Robe_.

  _Chi._ I'll no more Oracles, nor Miracles,
  Nor no more Church work, I'll be drawn and hang'd first.
  Am not I torn a pieces with the thunder?
  Death, I can scarce believe I live yet,
  It gave me on the buttocks, a cruel, a huge bang,
  I had as lieve ha' had 'em scratcht with Dog-whips:
  Be quiet henceforth, now ye feel the end on't,
  I would advise ye my old friends, the good Gentlewoman
  Is strucken dumb, and there her Grace sits mumping
  Like an old Ape eating a Brawn; sure the good Goddess
  Knew my intent was honest, to save the Princess,
  And how we young men are entic'd to wickedness,
  By these lewd Women, I had paid for't else too.
  I am monstrous holy now, and cruel fearful,
  O 'twas a plaguey thump, charg'd with a vengeance.

        _Enter_ Siphax, _walks softly over the stage, and goes in_.

  Would I were well at home; the best is, 'tis not day:
  Who's that? ha? _Siphax!_ I'll be with you anon, Sir;
  Ye shall be oracled I warrant ye,
  And thunder'd too, as well as I; your Lordship

        _Enter_ Memnon, Eumenes, Stremon, _and two carrying Torches_.

  Must needs enjoy the Princess, yes: ha! Torches?
  And _Memnon_ coming this way? he's Dog-mad,
  And ten to one appearing thus unto him,
  He worries me, I must go by him.

  _Eum._ Sir?

  _Mem._ Ask me no further questions; what art thou?
  How dost thou stare! stand off; nay look upon me,
  I do not shake, nor fear thee--                    [_Draws his Sword._

  _Chi._ He will kill me,
  This is for Church work.

  _Mem._ Why dost thou appear now?
  Thou wert fairly slain: I know thee, _Diocles_,
  And know thine envy to mine honour: but--

  _Chi._ Stay _Memnon_,
  I am a Spirit, and thou canst not hurt me.

  _Eum._ This is the voice of _Chilax_.

  _Strem._ What makes him thus?

  _Chi._ 'Tis true, that I was slain in field, but foully,
  By multitudes, not manhood: therefore mark me,
  I do appear again to quit mine honour,
  And on thee single.

  _Mem._ I accept the challenge.
  Where?

  _Chi._ On the Stygian Banks.

  _Mem._ When?

  _Chi._ Four days hence.

  _Mem._ Go noble Ghost, I will attend.

  _Chi._ I thank ye.

  _Stre._ Ye have sav'd your throat, and handsomly:
  Farewel, Sir.                                          [_Exit_ Chilax.

  _Mem._ Sing me the Battles of _Pelusium_,
  In which this Worthy dyed.

  _Eum._ This will spoil all, and make him worse
  Than e'r he was: sit down, Sir,
  And give your self to rest.

  SONG.

    _Arm, arm, arm, arm, the Scouts are all come in,_
    _Keep your Ranks close, and now your honours win._
    _Behold from yonder Hill, the Foe appears,_
    _Bows, Bills, Glaves, Arrows, Shields, and Spears,_
    _Like a dark Wood he comes, or tempest pouring;_
    _O view the Wings of Horse the Meadows scowring,_
    _The vant-guard marches bravely, hark, the Drums_--dub, dub.
    _They meet, they meet, and now the Battel comes:_
            _See how the Arrows fly,_
            _That darken all the Skye;_
            _Hark how the Trumpets sound,_
            _Hark how the Hills rebound._--Tara, tara, tara.
    _Hark how the Horses charge: in Boys, Boys in_--tara, tara.
        _The Battel totters; now the wounds begin;_
            _O how they cry,_
            _O how they dy!_
        _Room for the valiant _Memnon_ arm'd with thunder,_
            _See how he breaks the Ranks asunder:_
        _They flye, they flye, _Eumenes_ has the Chace,_
        _And brave _Polybius_ makes good his place._
            _To the Plains, to the Woods,_
            _To the Rocks, to the Floods,_
            _They flie for succour: Follow, follow, follow,_ Hey, hey.
            _Hark how the Souldiers hollow
            _Brave _Diocles_ is dead,_
            _And all his Souldiers fled,_
            _The Battel's won, and lost,_
            _That many a life hath cost._

  _Mem._ Now forward to the Temple.                           [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Chilax.

  _Chi._ Are ye gone?
  How have I 'scap'd this morning! by what miracle!
  Sure I am ordain'd for some brave end.

        _Enter_ Cloe.

  _Clo._ How is it?

  _Chi._ Come, 'tis as well as can be.

  _Clo._ But is it possible
  This should be true you tell me?

  _Chi._ 'Tis most certain.

  _Clo._ Such a gross Ass to love the Princess?

  _Chi._ Peace,
  Pull your Robe close about ye: you are perfect
  In all I taught ye?

  _Cl[o]._ Sure.

  _Chi._ Gods give thee good luck.
  'Tis strange my Brains should still be beating Knavery
  For all these dangers, but they are needful mischiefs,
  And such are Nuts to me; and I must do 'em.
  You will remember me--

  _Clo._ By this kiss, _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ No more of that, I fear another thunder.

  _Clo._ We are not i'th' Temple, man.

        _Enter_ Siphax.

  _Chi._ Peace, here he comes,
  Now to our business handsomly; away now.    [_Ex._ Chilax, _and_ Cloe.

  _Si._ 'Twas sure the Princess, for he kneel'd unto her,
  And she lookt every way: I hope the Oracle
  Has made me happy; me I hope she lookt for,

        _Enter_ Chilax, _and_ Cloe _at the other door_.

  Fortune, I will so honour thee, Love, so adore thee.
  She is here again, looks round about her, again too,
  'Tis done, I know 'tis done; 'tis _Chilax_ with her,
  And I shall know of him; who's that?

  _Chi._ Speak softly,
  The Princess from the Oracle.

  _Si._ She views me,
  By Heaven she beckons me.

  _Chi._ Come near, she wou'd have ye.

  _Si._ O royal Lady.                                [_Kisses her hand._

  _Chi._ She wills ye read that, for belike she's bound to silence
  For such a time; she is wondrous gracious to ye.

  _Si._ Heav'n make me thankful.

  _Chi._ She would have ye read it.                         [_He reads._

  _Si._ _Siphax_, the will of Heaven hath cast me on thee
  To be thy Wife, whose Will must be obey'd:
  Use me with honour, I shall love thee dearly,
  And make thee understand thy worths hereafter;
  Convey me to a secret Ceremony,
  That both our hearts and loves may be united,
  And use no Language, till before my Brother
  We both appear, where I will shew the Oracle,
  For till that time I am bound, I must not answer.

  _Si._ O happy I!

  _Chi._ Ye are a made man.

  _Si._ But _Chilax_,
  Where are her Women?

  _Chi._ None but your Graces Sister,
  Because she would have it private to the World yet,
  Knows of this business.

  _Si._ I shall thank thee, _Chilax_,
  Thou art a careful man.

  _Chi._ Your Graces Servant.

  _Si._ I'll find a fit place for thee.

  _Chi._ If you will not,
  There's a good Lady will, she points ye forward,
  Away and take your fortune; not a word, Sir:
  So, you are greas'd I hope.     [_Ex._ Si. _and_ Cloe, _manet_ Chilax.

        _Enter_ Stremon, _Fool, and Boy_.

  _Chi._ _Stremon_, Fool, _Picus_,
  Where have you left your Lord?

  _Strem._ I' th' Temple, _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ Why are ye from him?

  _Strem._ Why, the King is with him,
  And all the Lords.

  _Chi._ Is not the Princess there too?

  _Strem._ Yes.
  And the strangest Coil amongst 'em; She weeps bitterly:
  The King entreats, and frowns, my Lord like Autumn
  Drops off his hopes by handfulls, all the Temple
  Sweats with this Agony.

  _Chi._ Where's young _Polydore_?

  _Strem._ Dead, as they said, o' th' sudden.

  _Chi._ Dead?

  _Strem._ For certain,
  But not yet known abroad.

  _Chi._ There's a new trouble,
  A brave young man he was; but we must all dye.

  _Strem._ Did not the General meet you this morning
  Like a tall Stallion Nun?

  _Chi._ No more o' that, Boy.

  _Strem._ You had been ferretting.

  _Chi._ That's all one, Fool;
  My Master Fool that taught my wits to traffick,
  What has your Wisedom done? how have you profited?
  Out with your Audit: come, you are not empty,
  Put out mine eye with twelve-pence? do you shaker?
  What think you of this shaking? here's wit, Coxcomb,
  Ha Boys? ha my fine Rascals, here's a Ring,               { _Pulls out
  How right they go!                                        { a Purse._

  _Fool._ O let me ring the fore Bell.

  [_Chi._] And here are thumpers, Chiqueens, golden rogues,
  Wit, wit, ye Rascals.

  _Fool._ I have a Stye here, _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ I have no Gold to cure it, not a penny,
  Not one cross, Cavalier; we are dull Souldiers,
  Gross heavy-headed fellows; fight for Victuals?

  _Fool._ Why, ye are the Spirits of the time.

  _Chi._ By no means.

  _Fool._ The valiant firie.

  _Chi._ Fie, fie, no.

  _Fool._ Be-lee me, Sir.

  _Chi._ I wou'd I cou'd, Sir.

  _Fool._ I will satisfie ye.

  _Chi._ But I will not content you; alas poor Boy,
  Thou shew'st an honest Nature, weepst for thy Master,
  There's a red Rogue to buy thee Handkerchiefs.

  _Fool._ He was an honest Gentleman, I have lost too.

  _Chi._ You have indeed your labour, Fool; but _Stremon_,
  Dost thou want money too? no Vertue living?
  No firking out at fingers ends?

  _Strem._ It seems so.

  _Chi._ Will ye all serve me?

  _Strem._ Yes, when ye are Lord General,
  For less I will not go.

  _Chi._ There's Gold for thee then,
  Thou hast a Souldiers mind. Fool--

  _Fool._ Here, your first man.

  _Chi._ I will give thee for thy Wit, for 'tis a fine wit,
  A dainty diving Wit, hold up, just nothing,
  Go graze i' th' Commons, yet I am merciful--
  There's six-pence: buy a Saucer, steal an old Gown,
  And beg i' th' Temple for a Prophet, come away Boys,
  Let's see how things are carried, Fool, up Sirrah,
  You may chance get a dinner: Boy, your preferment
  I'll undertake, for your brave Masters sake,
  You shall not perish.

  _Fool._ _Chilax._

  _Chi._ Please me well, Fool.
  And you shall light my pipes: away to the Temple.
  But stay, the King's here, sport upon sport, Boys.

        _Enter King, Lords_, Siphax _kneeling_, Cloe _with a Vail_.

  _King._ What would you have, Captain?
  Speak suddenly, for I am wondrous busie.

  _Si._ A pardon, Royal Sir.

  _King._ For what?

  _Si._ For that
  Which was Heaven's Will, should not be mine alone, Sir;
  My marrying with this Lady.

  _King._ It needs no pardon,
  For Marriage is no Sin.

  _Si._ Not in it self, Sir;
  But in presuming too much: yet Heaven knows,
  So does the Oracle that cast it on me,
  And----the Princess, royal Sir.

  _King._ What Princess?

  _Si._ O be not angry my dread King, your Sister.

  _King._ My Sister; she's i' th' Temple, Man.

  _Si._ She is here, Sir.

  _Lord._ The Captain's mad, she's kneeling at the Altar.

  _King._ I know she is; with all my heart good Captain,
  I do forgive ye both: be unvail'd, Lady.         [_Puts off her Vail._
  Will ye have more forgiveness? the man's frantick,
  Come let's go bring her out: God give ye joy, Sir.

  _Si._ How, _Cloe_? my old _Cloe_?                  [_Ex. King, Lords._

  _Clo._ Even the same, Sir.

  _Chi._ Gods give your manhood much content.

  _Strem._ The Princess
  Looks something musty since her coming over.

  _Fool._ 'Twere good you'd brush her over.

  _Si._ Fools and Fidlers
  Make sport at my abuse too?

  _Fool._ O 'tis the Nature
  Of us Fools to make bold with one another,
  But you are wise, brave sirs.

  _Chi._ Cheer up your Princess,
  Believe it Sir, the King will not be angry,
  Or say he were; why, 'twas the Oracle.
  The Oracle, an't like your Grace, the Oracle.

  _Strem._ And who, most mighty _Siphax_?

  _Siph._ With mine own whore.

  _Cloe._ With whom else should ye marry, speak your conscience,
  Will ye transgress the law of Arms, that ever
  Rewards the Souldier with his own sins?

  _Siph._ Devils.

  _Cloe._ Ye had my maiden-head, my youth, my sweetness,
  Is it not justice then?--

  _Siph._ I see it must be,
  But by this hand, I'le hang a lock upon thee.

  _Cloe._ You shall not need, my honesty shall doe it.

  _Siph._ If there be wars in all the world--

  _Cloe._ I'le with ye,
  For you know I have been a Souldier,
  Come, curse on: when I need another Oracle.

  _Chi._ Send for me _Siphax_, I'le fit ye with a Princess,
  And so to both your honours.

  _Fool._ And your graces.

  _Siph._ The Devil grace ye all.

  _Cloe._ God a mercy _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ Shall we laugh half an hour now?

  _Strem._ No the King comes,
  And all the train.

  _Chi._ Away then, our Act's ended.                          [_Exeunt._

        _Enter King_, Calis, Memnon, _and_ Cleanthe, _Lords_.

  _King._ You know he do's deserve ye, loves ye dearly,
  You know what bloody violence had us'd               { _The Hearse
  Upon himself, but that his Brother crost it,         { ready, Polydor,
  You know the same thoughts still inhabit in him      { Eumenes &
  And covet to take birth: Look on him Lady,           { Captains._
  The wars have not so far consum'd him yet,
  Cold age disabled him, or sickness sunk him
  To be abhorr'd: look on his Honour Sister,
  That bears no stamp of time, no wrinkles on it,
  No sad demolishment, nor death can reach it:
  Look with the eyes of Heaven that nightly waken,
  To view the wonders of the glorious Maker,
  And not the weakness: look with your vertuous eyes,
  And then clad royaltie in all his conquests,
  His matchless love hung with a thousand merits,
  Eternal youth attending, Fame and Fortune,
  Time and Oblivion vexing at his vertues,
  He shall appear a miracle: look on our dangers,
  Look on the publick ruin.

  _Calis._ O, dear Brother.

  _King._ Fie, let us not like proud and greedy waters
  Gain to give off again: this is our Sea,
  And you his _Cynthia_, govern him, take heed,
  His flouds have been as high, and full as any,
  And gloriously now is got up to the girdle,
  The Kingdomes he hath purchas'd; noble Sister,
  Take not your vertue from him, O take heed
  We ebbe not now to nothing, take heed _Calis_.

  _Calis._ The will of Heaven not mine, which must not alter,
  And my eternal doom for ought I know
  Is fixt upon me; alas, I must love nothing,
  Nothing that loves again must I be blest with:
  The gentle Vine climbs up the Oke and clips him,
  And when the stroke comes, yet they fall together;
  Death, death must I enjoy, and live to love him,
  O noble Sir!

  _Mem._ Those tears are some reward yet,
  Pray let me wed your sorrows.

  _Calis._ Take 'em Souldier,
  They are fruitfull ones, lay but a sigh upon 'em,
  And straight they will conceive to infinites;
  I told ye what ye would find 'em.

        _Enter_ Funeral, _Captains following, and_ Eumenes.

  _King._ How now, what's this? more drops to th' Ocean?
  Whose body's this?

  _Eum._ The noble _Polydor_,
  This speaks his death.

  _Mem._ My Brother dead?

  _Calis._ O Goddess!
  O cruel, cruel _Venus_, here's my fortune.

  _King._ Read Captain.

  _Mem._ Read aloud: farewel my follies.
                        [Eumen. _reads to the Excellent Princess_ Calis.

  _Eum._ Be wise, as you are beauteous, love with judgement,
  And look with clear eyes on my noble Brother,
  Value desert and vertue, they are Jewels,
  Fit for your worth and wearing: take heed Lady,
  The Gods reward ingratitude most grievous;
  Remember me no more, or if you must,
  Seek me in noble _Memnons_ love, I dwell there:
  I durst not live, because I durst not wrong him,
  I can no more, make me eternal happy
  With looking down upon your loves. _Farewel._

  _Mem._ And did'st thou die for me?

  _King._ Excellent vertue!
  What will ye now doe?

  _Calis._ Dwell for ever here Sir.

  _Mem._ For me dear _Polydor_? O worthy young man!
  O love, love, love, love above recompence!
  Infinite love, infinite honesty!
  Good Lady leave, you must have no share here,
  Take home your sorrows: here's enough to store me,
  Brave glorious griefs! was ever such a Brother?
  Turn all the stories over in the world yet,
  And search through all the memories of mankind,
  And find me such a friend; h'as out done all,
  Outstript 'em sheerly, all, all, thou hast _Polydor_,
  To die for me; why, as I hope for happiness,
  'Twas one of the rarest thought on things,
  The bravest, and carried beyond compass of our actions,
  I wonder how he hit it, a young man too,
  In all the blossomes of his youth and beautie,
  In all the fulness of his veins and wishes
  Woo'd by that Paradise, that would catch Heaven;
  It starts me extreamly, thou blest Ashes,
  Thou faithfull monument, where love and friendship
  Shall while the world is, work new miracles.

  _Calis._ O! let me speak too.

  _Mem._ No not yet; thou man,
  (For we are but mans shadows,) only man,
  I have not words to utter him; speak Lady,
  I'le think a while.

  _Calis._ The Goddess grants me this yet,
  I shall enjoy the dead: no tomb shall hold thee
  But these two arms, no Trickments but my tears
  Over thy Hearse, my sorrows like sad arms
  Shall hang for ever: on the tuffest Marble
  Mine eyes shall weep thee out an Epitaph,
  Love at thy feet shall kneel, his smart bow broken;
  Faith at thy head, youth and the Graces mourners;
  O sweet young man!

  _King._ Now I begin to melt too.

  _Mem._ Have ye enough yet Lady? room for a gamester.
  To my fond Love, and all those idle fancies
  A long farewel, thou diedst for me dear _Polydor_,
  To give me peace, thou hast eternal glory,
  I stay and talk here; I will kiss thee first,
  And now I'le follow thee.                            [_Polydor rises._

  _Pol._ Hold, for Heavens sake!

  _Mem._ Ha!
  Does he live?
  Dost thou deceive me?

  _Pol._ Thus far,
  Yet for your good, and honour.

  _King._ Now dear Sister.

  _Calis._ The Oracle is ended, noble Sir,
  Dispose me now as you please.

  _Pol._ You are mine then?

  _Calis._ With all the joyes that may be.

  _Pol._ Your consent Sir?

  _King._ Ye have it freely.

  _Pol._ Walk along with me then,
  And as you love me, love my will.

  _Calis._ I will so.

  _Pol._ Here worthy Brother, take this vertuous Princess,
  Ye have deserv'd her nobly, she will love ye,
  And when my life shall bring ye peace, as she does,
  Command it, ye shall have it.

  _Mem._ Sir, I thank ye.

  _King._ I never found such goodness in such years.

  _Mem._ Thou shalt not over-doe me, though I die for't,
  O how I love thy goodness, my best Brother,
  You have given me here a treasure to enrich me,
  Would make the worthiest King alive a begger,
  What may I give you back again?

  _Pol._ Your love Sir.

  _Mem._ And you shall have it, even my dearest love,
  My first, my noblest love, take her again, Sir,
  She is yours, your honesty has over-run me,
  She loves ye, lose her not: excellent Princess,
  Injoy thy wish, and now get Generals.

  _Pol._ As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, Sir.

  _Mem._ As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, Sir;
  My Lord, the King.

  _Pol._ He will undoe himself Sir,
  And must without her perish; who shall fight then?
  Who shall protect your Kingdom?

  _Mem._ Give me hearing,
  And after that, belief, were she my soul
  (As I do love her equal) all my victories,
  And all the living names I have gain'd by war,
  And loving him that good, that vertuous good man,
  That only worthy of the name of Brother,
  I would resign all freely, 'tis all love
  To me, all marriage rites, the joy or issues
  To know him fruitfull, that has been so faithfull.

  _King._ This is the noblest difference; take your choice Sister.

  _Calis._ I see they are so brave, and noble both,
  I know not which to look on.

  _Pol._ Chuse discreetly,
  And vertue guide ye, there all the world in one man
  Stands at the mark.

  _Mem._ There all mans honestie,
  The sweetness of all youth--

  _Cal._ O God's!

  _Mem._ My Armour,
  By all the God's she's yours; my Arms, I say,
  And I beseech your Grace, give me imployment,
  That shall be now my Mistress, there my Courtship.

  _King._ Ye shall have any thing.

  _Mem._ Vertuous Lady,
  Remember me, your Servant now; Young man,
  You cannot over-reach me in your goodness;
  O love! how sweet thou look'st now! and how gentle!
  I should have slubber'd thee, and stain'd thy beauty;
  Your hand, your hand Sir!

  _King._ Take her, and Heaven bless her.

  _Mem._ So.

  _Pol._ 'Tis your will Sir, nothing of my merit;
  And as your royal gift, I take this blessing.

  _Cal._ And I from heaven this gentleman: thanks Goddess.

  _Mem._ So ye are pleas'd now Lady?

  _Calis._ Now or never.

  _Mem._ My cold stiffe carkass would have frozen ye,
  Wars, wars.

  _King._ Ye shall have wars.

  _Mem._ My next brave battel
  I dedicate to your bright honour, Sister,
  Give me a favour, that the world may know
  I am your Souldier.

  _Calis._ This, and all fair Fortunes.

  _Mem._ And he that bears this from me, must strike boldly.
                                                   [Cleanthe _kneeling_.

  _Calis._ I do forgive thee: be honest; no more wench.

  _King._ Come now to Revels, this blest day shall prove
  The happy crown of noble Faith and Love.                    [_Exeunt._




Prologue.


  _To please all's impossible, and to despair_
  _Ruins our selves, and damps the Writers care:_
  _Would we knew what to doe, or say, or when_
  _To find the mindes here equal with the men:_
  _But we must venture; now to Sea we goe,_
  _Faire fortune with us, give us room, and blow;_
  _Remember ye're all venturers; and in this Play_
  _How many twelve-peaces ye have 'stow'd this day:_
  _Remember for return of your delight,_
  _We launch, and plough through storms of fear, and spight:_
  _Give us your fore-winds fairly, fill our wings,_
  _And steer us right, and as the Saylor sings,_
  _Loaden with Wealth, on wanton seas, so we_
  _Shall make our home-bound-voyage chearfully;_
  _And you our noble Merchants, for your treasure_
  _Share equally the fraught, we run for pleasure._




Epilogue.


  _Here lyes the doubt now, let our Playes be good,_
  _Our own care sailing equall in this Flood;_
  _Our preparations new, new our Attire,_
  _Yet here we are becalmed still, still i' th' mire,_
  _Here we stick fast; Is there no way to clear_
  _This passage of your judgement, and our fear,_
  _No mitigation of that law? Brave friends,_
  _Consider we are yours, made for your ends,_
  _And every thing preserves it self, each will_
  _If not perverse, and crooked, utter still_
  _The best of that it ventures in: have care_
  _Ev'n for your pleasures sake, of what we are,_
  _And do not ruine all, You may frown still,_
  _But 'tis the nobler way, to check the will._




APPENDIX.


    _In the following references to the text the lines are numbered
    from the top of the page, including titles, acts, stage
    directions, &c., but not, of course, the headline or mere
    'rules.' Where, as in the lists of Persons Represented, there
    are double columns, the right-hand column is numbered after the
    left._

It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every
turned letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks
of exclamation and _vice versâ_. Full-stops have been silently inserted
at the ends of speeches and each fresh speaker has been given the
dignity of a fresh line: in the double-columned folio the speeches are
frequently run on. Only misprints of interest in the Quartos and the
First Folio are recorded.
