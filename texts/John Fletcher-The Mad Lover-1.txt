_Actus primus. Scena prima._


        _Flourish._ _Enter_ Astorax _King of_ Paphos, _his Sister_
        Calis, _Train_, _and_ Cleanthe, Lucippe _Gentlewomen, at
        one door; at the other_ Eumenes _a Souldier_.

  _Eume._ Health to my Soveraign.

  _King._ _Eumenes_, welcome:
  Welcome to _Paphos_, Souldier, to our love,
  And that fair health ye wish us, through the Camp
  May it disperse it self, and make all happy;
  How does the General, the valiant _Memnon_,
  And how his Wars, _Eumenes_?

  _Eume._ The Gods have giv'n you (Royal Sir) a Souldier,
  Better ne're sought a danger, more approv'd
  In way of War, more master of his fortunes,
  Expert in leading 'em; in doing valiant,
  In following all his deeds to Victories,
  And holding fortune certain there.

  _King._ O Souldier,
  Thou speak'st a man indeed; a Generals General,
  A soul conceiv'd a Souldier.

  _Eumen._ Ten set Battels
  Against the strong usurper _Diocles_
  (Whom long experience had begot a Leader,
  Ambition rais'd too mighty) hath your _Memnon_
  Won, and won gloriously, distrest and shook him
  Even from the head of all his hopes to nothing:
  In three, he beat the Thunder-bolt his Brother,
  Forc'd him to wall himself up: there not safe,
  Shook him with warlike Engins like an Earthquake,
  Till like a Snail he left his shell and crawl'd
  By night and hideous darkness to destruction:
  Disarm'd for ever rising more: Twelve Castles,
  Some thought impregnable; Towns twice as many;
  Countries that like the wind knew no command
  But savage wildness, hath this General
  With loss of blood and youth, through Storms and Tempests
  Call'd to your fair obedience.

  _King._ O my Souldier
  That thou wert now within my arms; what drums               { _Drums
  Are those that beat _Eumenes_?                              { within._

  _Eumen._ His, my Soveraign;
  Himself i'th' head of conquest drawing home,
  An old man now to offer up his glories,
  And endless conquest at your shrine.

  _King._ Goe all,
  And entertain him with all Ceremonie,
  We'l keep him now a Courtier.

  _Eumen._ Sir, a strange one,
  Pray God his language bear it; by my life, Sir
  He knows no complement, nor curious casting
  Of words into fit places e're he speak 'em,
  He can say fight well fellow, and I'le thank thee:
  He that must eat, must fight; bring up the rear there,
  Or charge that wing of horse home.                        [_Flourish._

  _King._ Goe too, goe too.

        _Enter_ Memnon, _and a train of Courtiers, and Souldiers,
        two Captains_, Chilax.

  Valiant and wise are twins Sir: welcom, welcom,
  Welcom my fortunate and famous General,
  High in thy Princes favour, as in fame,
  Welcom to Peace, and _Paphos_.

  _Mem._ Thank your Grace,
  And would to God my dull tongue had that sweetness
  To thank you as I should; but pardon me,
  My sword and I speak roughly Sir: your battels
  I dare well say, I have fought well; for I bring ye
  That lazie end you wish for Peace, so fully,
  That no more name of war is: who now thinks
  Sooner or safer these might have been ended,
  Begin 'em if he dare again; I'le thank him.
  Souldier and Souldiers Mate these twenty five years,
  At length your General, (as one whose merit
  Durst look upon no less,) I have waded through
  Dangers would damp these soft souls, but to hear of.
  The maidenheads of thousand lives hang here Sir,
  Since which time Prince, I know no Court but Marshal,
  No oylie language, but the shock of Arms,
  No dalliance but with death; No lofty measures
  But weary and sad marches, cold and hunger,
  Larums at midnight Valours self would shake at,
  Yet I ne're shrunk: Balls of consuming Wildfire,
  That lickt men up like lightning, have I laught at,
  And tost 'em back again like childrens trifles.
  Upon the edges of my Enemies swords
  I have marcht like whirle-winds, fury at this hand waiting,
  Death at my right; Fortune my forlorn hope,
  When I have grapled with destruction,
  And tug'd with pale fac'd Ruine, Night and Mischief,
  Frighted to see a new day break in bloud;
  And every where I conquer'd; and for you Sir,
  Mothers have wanted wombs to make me famous,
  And blown ambition, dangers; Those that griev'd ye,
  I have taken order for i'th' earth: those fools
  That shall hereafter--

  _King._ No more wars my Souldier:             { _K. takes_ Mem. _aside
  We must now treat of peace Sir.               { and talks with him_.

  _Clean._ How he talks,
  How gloriously.

  _Cal._ A goodly timber'd fellow,
  Valiant no doubt.

  _Cle._ If valour dwell in vaunting;
  In what a phrase he speaks, as if his actions
  Could be set off in nothing but a noise;
  Sure h'as a drum in's mouth.

  _Cal._ I wonder wenches
  How he would speak to us.

  _Clean._ Nothing but Larum,
  Tell us whose throat he cut, shew us his sword,
  And bless it for sure biting.

  _Lucippe._ And 't like your Grace,
  I do not think he knows us what we are,
  Or to what end; for I have heard his followers
  Affirm he never saw a woman that exceeded
  A Sutlers wife yet, or in execution
  Old bedrid Beldames without teeth or tongues,
  That would not flie his furie? how he looks.

  _Clea._ This way devoutly.

  _Cal._ Sure his Lordship's viewing
  Our Fortifications.

  _Lucip._ If he mount at me,
  I may chance choak his Battery.

  _Cal._ Still his eye
  Keeps quarter this way: _Venus_ grant his valour
  Be not in love.

  _Clean._ If he be, presently
  Expect a Herald and a Trumpet with ye
  To bid ye render; we two Perdu's pay for't else.

  _King._ I'le leave ye to my sister, and these Ladies
  To make your welcom fuller: my good souldier
  We must now turn your sternness into Courtship;
  When ye have done there, to your fair repose Sir:         [_Flourish._
  I know you need it _Memnon_; welcom Gentlemen.           [_Exit_ King.

  _Luci._ Now he begins to march: Madam the Van's yours,
  Keep your ground sure; 'tis for your spurrs.

  _Mem._ O _Venus_.                             {
                                                { _He kneels amaz'd,
  _Cal._ How he stares on me.                   { and forgets to speak._

  _Clean._ Knight him Madam, knight him,
  He will grow toth' ground else.

  _Eumenes._ Speak Sir, 'tis the Princess.

  _1 Cap._ Ye shame your self, speak to her.

  _Cal._ Rise and speak Sir.
  Ye are welcome to the Court, to me, to all Sir.

  _Lucip._ Is he not deaf?

  _Cal._ The Gentleman's not well.

  _Eumen._ Fie noble General.

  _Lucip._ Give him fresh air, his colour goes, how do ye?
  The Princess will be glad Sir.

  _Mem._ Peace, and hear me.

  _Clean._ Command a silence there.

  _Mem._ I love thee Lady.

  _Cal._ I thank your Lordship heartily: proceed Sir.

  _Lucip._ Lord how it stuck in's stomach like a surfeit.

  _Clean._ It breaks apace now from him, God be thanked,
  What a fine spoken man he is.

  _Lucip._ A choice one, of singular variety in carriage.

  _Clean._ Yes and I warrant you he knows his distance.

  _Mem._ With all my heart I love thee.

  _Cal._ A hearty Gentleman,
  And I were e'en an arrant beast, my Lord,
  But I lov'd you again.

  _Mem._ Good Lady kiss me.

  _Clean._ I marry, _Mars_, there thou cam'st close up to her.

  _Cal._ Kiss you at first my Lord? 'tis no fair fashion,
  Our lips are like Rose buds, blown with mens breaths,
  They lose both sap and savour; there's my hand Sir.

  _Eumen._ Fie, fie, my Lord, this is too rude.

  _Mem._ Unhand me,
  Consume me if I hurt her; good sweet Lady
  Let me but look upon thee.

  _Cal._ Doe.

  _Mem._ Yet--

  _Cal._ Well Sir,
  Take your full view.

  _Lucip._ Bless your eyes Sir.

  _Cal._ Mercy,
  Is this the man they talkt of for a Souldier,
  So absolute and Excellent: O the Gods,
  If I were given to that vanitie
  Of making sport with men for ignorance,
  What a most precious subject had I purchas'd!
  Speak for him Gentlemen: some one that knows,
  What the man ails; and can speak sense.

  _Clean._ Sure Madam,
  This fellow has been a rare Hare finder.
  See how his eyes are set.

  _Cal._ Some one goe with me,
  I'le send him something for his head, poor Gentleman,
  He's troubled with the staggers.

  _Lucip._ Keep him dark,
  He will run March mad else, the fumes of Battels
  Ascend into his brains.

  _Clean._ Clap to his feet
  An old Drum head, to draw the thunder downward.

  _Cal._ Look to him Gentlemen: farewel, Lord I am sorry
  We cannot kiss at this time, but believe it
  We'l find an hour for all: God keep my Children,
  From being such sweet Souldiers; Softly wenches,
  Lest we disturb his dream.               [_Exeunt_ Calis _and_ Ladies.

  _Eumen._ Why this is Monstrous.

  _1 Capt._ A strange forgetfulness, yet still he holds it.

  _2 Capt._ Though he ne're saw a woman of great fashion
  Before this day, yet methinks 'tis possible
  He might imagine what they are, and what
  Belongs unto 'em: meer report of others.

  _Eumen._ Pish, his head had other whimsies in't: my Lord,
  Death I think y'are struck dumb; my good Lord General.

  _1 Capt._ Sir.

  _Mem._ That I do love ye Madam; and so love ye
  An't like your grace.

  _2 Capt._ He has been studying this speech.

  _Eumen._ Who do ye speak to Sir?

  _Mem._ Why where's the Lady,
  The woman, the fair woman?

  _1 Capt._ Who?

  _Mem._ The Princess,
  Give me the Princess.

  _Eumen._ Give ye counsel rather
  To use her like a Princess: Fy my Lord,
  How have you born your self, how nakedl[y]
  Laid your soul open, and your ignorance
  To be a sport to all. Report and honour
  Drew her to doe you favours, and you bluntly,
  Without considering what, or who she was,
  Neither collecting reason, nor distinction.

  _Mem._ Why, what did I my Masters?

  _Eumen._ All that shews
  A man unhandsom, undigested dough.

  _Mem._ Did not I kneel unto her?

  _Eumen._ Dumb and sensless,
  As though ye had been cut out for your fathers tomb,
  Or stuck a land-mark; when she spoke unto you,
  Being the excellence of all our Island,
  Ye star'd upon her, as ye had seen a monster.

  _Me[m]._ Was I so foolish? I confess _Eumenes_,
  I never saw before so brave an outside,
  But did I kneel so long?

  _Eumen._ Till they laught at ye,
  And when you spoke I am asham'd to tell ye
  What 'twas my Lord; how far from order;
  Bless me, is't possible the wild noise of war
  And what she only teaches should possess ye?
  Knowledge to treat with her, and full discretion
  Being at flood still in ye: and in peace,
  And manly conversation smooth and civil,
  Where gracefulness and glory twyn together,
  Thrust your self out an exile?
  Do you know Sir, what state she carries?
  What great obedience waits at her beck continually?

  _Mem._ She ne're commanded
  A hundred thousand men, as I have done,
  Nor ne're won battel; Say I would have kist her.

  _Eumen._ There was a dainty offer too, a rare one.

  _Mem._ Why, she is a woman, is she not?

  _Eumen._ She is so.

  _Mem._ Why, very well; what was she made for then?
  Is she not young, and handsom, bred to breed?
  Do not men kiss fair women? if they doe,
  If lips be not unlawfull ware; Why a Princess
  Is got the same way that we get a begger
  Or I am cozen'd; and the self-same way
  She must be handled e're she get another,
  That's rudeness is it not?

  _2 Capt._ To her 'tis held so, & rudeness in that high degree--

  _Mem._ 'Tis reason,
  But I will be more punctual; pray what thought she?

  _Eum._ Her thoughts were merciful, but she laught at ye,
  Pitying the poorness of your complement,
  And so she left ye. Good Sir shape your self
  To understand the place, and noble persons
  You live with now.

  _1 Capt._ Let not those great deserts
  The King hath laid up of ye, and the people,
  Be blasted with ill bearing.

  _Eume._ The whole name of souldier then will suffer.

  _Mem._ She's a sweet one,
  And good sirs leave your exhortations,
  They come untimely to me, I have brains
  That beat above your reaches: She's a Princess,
  That's all: I have killed a King, that's greater.
  Come let's to dinner, if the Wine be good,
  You shall perceive strange wisdom in my blood.
                                               [_Exeunt all but_ Chilax.

  _Chil._ Well, would thou wert i' the wars again
  Old _Memnon_, there thou wouldst talk toth' purpose,
  And the proudest of all these Court Camelions
  Would be glad to find it sense too: pla[gu]e of this
  Dead peace, this Bastard breeding, lowzie, lazie idleness,
  Now we must learn to pipe, and pick our livings
  Out of old rotten ends: these twenty five years
  I have serv'd my Country, lost my youth and bloud,
  Expos'd my life to dangers more than dayes;
  Yet let me tell my wants, I know their answers,
  The King is bound to right me, they good people
  Have but from hand to mouth. Look to your wives
  Your young trim wives, your high-day wives, your marchpanes,
  For if the souldiers find not recompence,
  As yet there's none a hatching; I believe
  You men of wares, the men of wars will nick ye,
  For starve nor beg they must not; my small means
  Are gone _in fumo_: here to raise a better
  Unless it be with lying, or Dog flattering,
  At which our Nation's excellent; observing Dog-days,
  When this good Lady broyles and would be basted
  By that good Lord, or such like moral learnings,
  Is here impossible; Well; I will rub among 'em
  If any thing for honestie be gotten,
  Though't be but bread and cheese I can be satisfied:
  If otherwise the wind blow, stiff as I am
  Yet I shall learn to shuffle: There's an old Lass
  That shall be nameless yet alive, my last hope,
  Has often got me my pocket full of crowns.
  If all fail--Jack-Dawes, are you alive still?
  Then I see the coast clear, when fools and boyes can prosper.

        _Enter_ Fool, _and_ Page.

  _Page._ Brave Lieutenant.

  _Fool._ Hail to the man of worship.

  _Chi._ You are fine sirs,
  Most passing fine at all points.

  _Fool._ As ye see Sir,
  Home-bred and handsome, we cut not out our clothes Sir
  At half sword as your Taylors doe, and pink 'em
  With Pikes and Partizans, we live retir'd Sir
  Gentlemen like, and jealous of our honours.

  _Chi._ Very fine Fool, and fine Boy, Peace playes with you,
  As the wind playes with Feathers, dances ye,
  You grind with all gusts, gallants.

  _Page._ We can bounce Sir,
  When you Soldados bend i'th' hams, and frisk too.

  _Fool._ When twenty of your trip-coats turn their tippets,
  And your cold sallets without salt or vineger
  Be wambling in your stomachs; hemp and hobnails
  Will bear no price now, hangings and old harness
  Are like to over-run us.

  _Pa._ Whores and hot houses.

  _Fool._ Surgeons and Syringes ring out your sance-bells.

  _Page._ Your Jubile, your Jubile.

  _Fool._ _Prob Deum._
  How our St. _Georges_ will bestride the Dragons,
  The red and ramping Dragons.

  _Page._ Advanc't fool--

  _Fool._ But then the sting i'th' tail boy.

  _Page._ _Tanto Melior._
  For so much the more danger, the more honour.

  _Chi._ You're very pleasant with our occupation Gent.
  Which very like amongst these fierie Serpents
  May light upon a Blind-worm of your blood,
  A Mother or a Sister.

  _Fool._ Mine's past saddle,
  You should be sure of her else: but say Sir _Huon_,
  Now the Drums dubbs, and the sticks turn'd bed-staves,
  All the old Foxes hunted to their holes,
  The Iron age return'd to _Erebus_,
  And _Honorificabilitudinitatibus_
  Thrust out o'th' Kingdom by the head and shoulders,
  What trade do you mean to follow?

  _Chi._ That's a question.

  _Fool._ Yes and a learned question if ye mark it,
  Consider and say on.

  _Chi._ Fooling as thou dost, that's the best trade I take it.

  _Fool._ Take it straight then
  For fear your fellows be before ye, hark ye Lieutenant
  Fooling's the thing, the thing worth all your fightings,
  When all's done ye must fool Sir.

  _Chi._ Well, I must then.

  _Fool._ But do you know what fooling is? true fooling,
  The circumstances that belong unto it?
  For every idle knave that showes his teeth,
  Wants and would live, can juggle, tumble, fiddle,
  Make a dog face, or can abuse his fellow,
  Is not a fool at first dash; you shall find Sir
  Strange turnings in this trade; to fool is nothing
  As fooling has been, but to fool the fair way,
  The new way, as the best men fool their friends,
  For all men get by fooling, meerly fooling,
  Desert does nothing, valiant, wise, vertuous,
  Are things that walk by without bread or breeches.

  _Chi._ I partly credit that.

  _Fool._ Fine wits, fine wits Sir,
  There's the young Boy, he does well in his way too,
  He could not live else in his Masters absence;
  He tyes a Ladyes garters so, so prettily,
  Say his hand slip, but say so.

  _Chi._ Why let it slip then.

  _Fool._ 'Tis ten to one the body shall come after,
  And he that works deserves his wages.

  _Chi._ That's true.

  _Fool._ He riddles finely to a waiting Gentlewoman,
  Expounds dreams like a Prophet, dreams himself too,
  And wishes all dreams true; they cry Amen,
  And there's a _Memorandum_: he can sing too
  Bawdy enough to please old Ladies: he lies rarely,
  Pawns ye a sute of clothes at all points, fully,
  Can pick a pocket if ye please, or casket;
  Lisps when he lists to catch a Chambermaid,
  And calls his Hostess mother, these are things now,
  If a man mean to live: to fight and swagger,
  Beaten about the Ears with bawling sheepskins,
  Cut to the soul for Summer: here an arm lost,
  And there a leg; his honourable head
  Seal'd up in salves and cereclothes, like a packet,
  And so sent over to an Hospital, stand there, charge there,
  Swear there, whore there, dead there,
  And all this sport for cheese, and chines of dog-flesh,
  And mony when two wednesdayes meet together,
  Where to be lowzie is a Gentleman,
  And he that wears a clean shirt has his shrowd on.

  _Chi._ I'le be your scholar, come if I like fooling.

  _Fool._ You cannot choose but like it, fight you one day
  I'le fool another, when your Surgeon's paid,
  And all your leaks stopt, see whose slops are heaviest,
  I'le have a shilling for a can of wine,
  When you shall have two Sergeants for a Counter.

  _Boy._ Come learn of us Lieutenant, hang your Iron up,
  We'l find you cooler wars.

  _Chi._ Come let's together,
  I'le see your tricks, and as I like 'em.--                  [_Exeunt._

      _Enter_ Memnon, Eumenes, _and Captains_.

  _Mem._ Why was there not such women in the camp then
  Prepar'd to make me know 'em?

  _Eum._ 'Twas no place Sir.

  _1 Capt._ Why should they live in Tumults? they are creatures
  Soft and of sober natures.

  _Mem._ Cou'd not your wives,
  Your Mothers, or your Sisters have been sent for
  To exercise upon?

  _Eume._ We thank your Lordship.

  _2 Capt._ But do you mean?

  _Mem._ I do mean.

  _2 Capt._ What Sir?

  _Mem._ To see her,
  And see thee hang'd too an thou anger'st me,
  And thousands of your throats cut, get ye from me,
  Ye keep a prating of your points of manners,
  And fill my head with lowzie circumstances,
  Better have Ballads in't, your courtly worships,
  How to put off my hat, you, how to turn me,
  And you (forsooth) to blow my nose discreetly;
  Let me alone, for I will love her, see her,
  Talk to her, and mine own way.

  _Eume._ She's the Princess.

  _Mem._ Why let her be the Devil, I have spoke
  When Thunder durst not check me, I must love,
  I know she was a thing kept for me.

  _Eume._ And I know Sir,
  Though she were born yours, yet your strange behaviour
  And want--

  _Mem._ Thou liest.

  _Eum._ I do not.

  _Mem._ Ha!

  _Eume._ I do not lye Sir,
  I say you want fair language, nay 'tis certain
  You cannot say good morrow.

  _Mem._ Ye Dog-whelps,
  The proudest of your prating tongues--

  _Eume._ Doe, kill us,
  Kill us for telling truth: for my part, General,
  I would not live to see men make a may-game
  Of him I have made a Master, kill us quickly,
  Then ye may--

  _Mem._ What?

  _Eume._ Doe what you list, draw your sword childishly
  Upon your Servants that are bound to tell ye;
  I am weary of my life.

  _1 Capt._ And I.

  _2 Capt._ And all Sir.

  _Eume._ Goe to the Princess, make her sport, cry to her
  I am the glorious man of war.

  _Mem._ Pray ye leave me,
  I am sorry I was angry, I'le think better,
  Pray no more words.

  _Eume_. Good Sir.

  _Mem._ Nay then.

  _2 Capt._ We are gone Sir.                 [_Exeunt_ Eume. _and Capt_.

        _Enter_ Princess Calis, Lucippe, Cleanthe.

  _Cal._ How came he hither? see for Heavens sake wenches,
  What face, and what postures he puts on,           { _Mem. walks aside
  I do not think he is perfect.                      { full of strange
                                                     { gestures._
  _Cle._ If your love
  Have not betray'd his little wits, he's well enough,
  As well as he will be.

  _Cal._ Mark how he muses.

  _Lucip._ H'as a Batalia now in's brains, he draws out, now
  Have at ye Harpers.

  _Cle._ See, see, there the fire fails.

  _Lucip._ Look what an Alphabet of faces he runs through.

  _Cle._ O love, love, how amorously thou look'st
  In an old rusty armour.

  _Cle._ I'll away, for by my troth I fear him.

  _Lucip_. Fear the gods, Madam,
  And never care what man can do, this fellow
  With all his frights about him and his furies,
  His Larums, and his Launces, Swords, and Targets,
  Nay case him up in armour Cap-a-pe,
  Yet durst I undertake within two hours,
  If he durst charge, to give him such a shake,
  Should shake his Valour off, and make his shanks to ake.

  _Cle._ For shame no more.

  _Cal._ He muses still.

  _Cle._ The Devil--
  Why should this old dryed timber chopt with thunder--

  _Cal._ Old Wood burns quickest.

  _Lucip._ Out, you would say Madam,
  Give me a green stick that may hold me heat,
  And smoak me soundly too; He turns, and sees ye.     { Memnon
                                                       { _comes to her_.
  _Cle._ There's no avoiding now, have at ye.

  _Mem._ Lady.
  The more I look upon ye.                                 [_Stays her._

  _Cle._ The more you may, Sir.

  _Cal._ Let him alone.

  _Mem._ I would desire your patience.
  The more I say I look, the more--                        [_Stays her._

  _Lucip._ My Fortune,
  'Tis very apt, Sir.

  _Mem._ Women, let my Fortune
  And me alone I wish ye, pray come this way,
  And stand you still there Lady.

  _Cal._ Leave the words Sir, and leap into the meaning.

  _Mem._ Then again:
  I tell you I do love ye.

  _Cal._ Why?

  _Mem._ No questions: pray no more questions.
  I do love you, infinitely: why do you smile?
  Am I ridiculous?

  _Cal._ I am monstrous fearful, no, I joy you love me.

  _Mem._ Joy on then, and be proud on't, I do love you,
  Stand still, do not trouble me you Women.
  He loves you Lady at whose feet have kneel'd
  Princes to beg their freedoms, he whose valour
  Has overrun whole Kingdoms.

  _Cal._ That makes me doubt, Sir,
  'Twill overrun me too.

  _Mem._ He whose Sword.

  _Cle._ Talk not so big, Sir, you will fright the Princess.

  _Mem._ Ha.

  _Lucippe._ No forsooth.

  _Cal._ I know ye have done wonders.

  _Mem._ I have and will do more and greater, braver;
  And for your beauty miracles, name that Kingdom
  And take your choice.

  _Cal._ Sir I am not ambitious.

  _Mem._ Ye shall be, 'tis the Child of Glory: she that I love
  Whom my desires shall magnifie, time stories,
  And all the Empires of the Earth.

  _Cle._ I would fain ask him--

  _Lucip._ Prithee be quiet, he will beat us both else.

  _Cle._ What will ye make me then, Sir?

  _Mem._ I will make thee
  Stand still and hold thy peace; I have a heart, Lady.

  _Cal._ Ye were a monster else.

  _Mem._ A loving heart,
  A truly loving heart.

  _Cal._ Alas, how came it?

  _Mem._ I would you had it in your hand, sweet Lady,
  To see the truth it bears you.

  _Cal._ Do you give it.

  _Lucip._ That was well thought upon.

  _Cle._ 'Twill put him to't Wench.

  _Cal._ And you shall see I dare accept it, Sir,
  Tak't in my hand and view it: if I find it
  A loving and a sweet heart, as you call it,
  I am bound, I am.

  _Mem._ No more, I'll send it to ye,
  As I have honour in me, you shall have it.

  _Cle._ Handsomly done, Sir, and perfum'd by all means,
  The Weather's warm, Sir.

  _Mem._ With all circumstance.

  _Lucip._ A Napkin wrought most curiously.

  _Mem._ Divinely.

  _Cle._ Put in a Goblet of pure Gold.

  _Mem._ Yes in _Jacinth_
  That she may see the Spirit through.

  _Lucip._ Ye have greas'd him
  For chewing love again in haste.

  _Cle._ If he should do it.

  _Cal._ If Heaven should fall we should have larks; he do it!

  _Cle._ See how he thinks upon't.

  _Cal._ He will think these three years
  Ere he prove such an Ass, I lik't his offer,
  There was no other way to put him off else.

  _Mem._ I will do it--
  Lady expect my heart.

  _Cal._ I do, Sir.

  _Mem._ Love it, for 'tis a heart that--and so I leave ye.
                                                            [_Exit_ Mem.

  _Cle._ Either he is stark mad,
  Or else I thinks he means it.

  _Cal._ He must be stark mad
  Or else he will never do it, 'tis vain Glory,
  And want of judgment that provokes this in him;
  Sleep and Society cures all: his heart?
  No, no, good Gentleman there's more belongs to't,
  Hearts are at higher prices, let's go in
  And there examine him a little better.
  Shut all the doors behind for fear he follow,
  I hope I have lost a lover, and am glad on't.             [_Ex._ Lady.




_Actus Secundus. Scena Prima._


        _Enter_ Memnon _alone_.

  _Mem._ 'Tis but to dye, Dogs do it, Ducks with dabling,
  Birds sing away their Souls, & Babies sleep 'em,
  Why do I talk of that is treble vantage?
  For in the other World she is bound to have me;
  Her Princely word is past: my great desert too
  Will draw her to come after presently,
  'Tis justice, and the gods must see it done too.
  Besides, no Brother, Father, Kindred there
  Can hinder us, all languages are alike too.
  There love is everlasting, ever young,
  Free from Diseases, ages, jealousies,
  Bawds, Beldames, Painters, Purgers: dye? 'tis nothing,
  Men drown themselves for joy to draw in Juleps
  When they are hot with Wine: In dreams we do it.
  And many a handsom Wench that loves the sport well,
  Gives up her Soul so in her Lovers bosome;
  But I must be incis'd first, cut and open'd,
  My heart, and handsomely, ta'n from me; stay there,
  Dead once, stay, let me think again, who do I know there?
  For else to wander up and down unwaited on
  And unregarded in my place and project,
  Is for a Sowters Soul, not an old Souldiers.
  My brave old Regiments--I there it goes,
  That have been kill'd before me, right.--

        _Enter_ Chilax.

  _Chil._ He's here, and I must trouble him.

  _Mem._ Then those I have conquer'd
  To make my train full.

  _Chi._ Sir.

  _Mem._ My Captains then--

  _Chi._ Sir, I beseech ye.

  _Mem._ For to meet her there
  Being a Princess and a Kings sole Sister
  With great accommodation must be cared for.

  _Chi._ Weigh but the Souldiers poverty.

  _Mem._ Mine own Troop first
  For they shall die.

  _Chi._ How, what's this?

  _Mem._ Next--

  _Chi._ Shall I speak louder, Sir?

  _Mem._ A square Battalia--

  _Chi._ You do not think of us.

  _Mem._ Their Armours gilded--

  _Chi._ Good noble Sir.

  _Mem._ And round about such Engines
  Shall make Hell shake.

  _Chi._ Ye do not mock me.

  _Mem._ For, Sir,
  I will be strong, as brave--

  _Chi._ Ye may consider,
  You know we have serv'd you long enough.

  _Mem._ No Souldier
  That ever landed on the blest _Elyzium_
  Did or shall march, as I will.

  _Chi._ Would ye would march, Sir,
  Up to the King and get us--

  _Mem._ King nor _Keiser_
  Shall equal me in that world.

  _Chi._ What a Devil ails he?

  _Mem._ Next, the rare beauties of those Towns I fir'd.

  _Chi._ I speak of money, Sir.

  _Mem._ Ten thousand Coaches--

  _Chi._ O pounds, Sir, pounds I beseech your Lordship,
  Let Coaches run out of your remembrance.

  _Mem._ In which the wanton _Cupids_, and the Graces
  Drawn with the Western winds kindling desires,
  And then our Poets--

  _Chi._ Then our pay.

  _Mem._ For _Chilax_ when the triumph comes; the Princess
  Then, for I will have a Heaven made--

  _Chi._ Bless your Lordship!
  Stand still, Sir.

  _Mem._ So I do, and in it--

  _Chi._ Death Sir,
  You talk you know not what.

  _Mem._ Such rare devices:
  Make me I say a Heaven.

  _Chi._ I say so too, Sir.

  _Mem._ For here shall run a Constellation.

  _Chi._ And there a pissing Conduit.

  _Mem._ Ha!

  _Chi._ With wine, Sir.

  _Mem._ A Sun there in his height, there such a Planet.

  _Chi._ But where's our money, where runs that?

  _Mem._ Ha?

  _Chi._ Money,
  Money an't like your Lordship.

  _Mem._ Why all the carriage shall come behind, the stuff,
  Rich hangings, treasure;
  Or say we have none.

  _Chi._ I may say so truly,
  For hang me if I have a Groat: I have serv'd well
  And like an honest man: I see no reason--

  _Mem._ Thou must needs die good _Chilax_.

  _Chi._ Very well, Sir.

  _Mem._ I will have honest, valiant souls about me,
  I cannot miss thee.

  _Chi._ Dye?

  _Mem._ Yes die, and _Pelius_,
  _Eumenes_ and _Polybius_: I shall think
  Of more within these two hours.

  _Chi._ Dye Sir?

  _Mem._ I, Sir,
  And ye shall dye.

  _Chi._ When, I beseech your Lordship?

  _Mem._ To morrow see ye do dye.

  _C[h]i._ A short warning,
  Troth, Sir, I am ill prepar'd.

  _Mem._ I dye my self then,
  Beside there's reason--

  _Chi._ Oh!

  _Mem._ I pray thee tell me,
  For thou art a great Dreamer.

  _Chi._ I can dream, Sir,
  If I eat well and sleep well.

  _Mem._ Was it never
  By Dream or Apparition open'd to thee--

  _Chi._ He's mad.

  _Mem._ What the other world was, or _Elyzium_?
  Didst never travel in thy sleep?

  _Chi._ To Taverns,
  When I was drunk o're night; or to a Wench,
  There's an _Elyzium_ for ye, a young Lady
  Wrapt round about ye like a Snake: is that it?
  Or if that strange _Elyzium_ that you talk of
  Be where the Devil is, I have dream't of him,
  And that I have had him by the horns, and rid him,
  He trots the Dagger out o'th' sheath.

  _Mem._ _Elyzium_,
  The blessed fields man.

  _Chi._ I know no fields blessed, but those I have gain'd by.
  I have dream't I have been in Heaven too.

  _Mem._ There, handle that place; that's _Elyzium_.

  _Chi._ Brave singing, and brave dancing,
  And rare things.

  _Mem._ All full of flowers.

  _Chi._ And Pot-herbs.

  _Mem._ Bowers for lovers,
  And everlasting ages of delight.

  _Chi._ I slept not so far.

  _Mem._ Meet me on those banks
  Some two days hence.

  _Chi._ In Dream, Sir?

  _Mem._ No in death, Sir.
  And there I Muster all, and pay the Souldier.
  Away, no more, no more.

  _Chi._ God keep your Lordship:
  This is fine dancing for us.

        _Enter_ Siphax.

  _Si._ Where's the General?

  _Chi._ There's the old sign of _Memnon_, where the soul is
  You may go look as I have.

  _Si._ What's the matter?

  _Chi._ Why question him and see; he talks of Devils,
  Hells, Heavens, Princes, Powers, and Potentates,
  You must to th' pot too.

  _Si._ How?

  _Chi._ Do you know _Elyzium_? a tale he talks the Wild-goose chase of.

  _Si._ _Elyzium?_ I have read of such a place.

  _Chi._ Then get ye to him,
  Ye are as fine company as can be fitted.               [_Exit_ Chilax.
  Your Worships fairly met.

  _Si._ Mercy upon us,
  What ails this Gentleman?

  _Mem._ Provision--

  _Si._ How his head works!

  _Mem._ Between two Ribbs,
  If he cut short or mangle me; I'le take him
  And twirle his neck about.

  _Si._ Now Gods defend us.

  _Mem._ In a pure Cup transparent, with a writing
  To signifie--

  _Si._ I never knew him thus:
  Sure he's bewitch'd, or poyson'd.

  _Mem._ Who's there?

  _Si._ I Sir.

  _Mem._ Come hither, _Siphax_.

  _Si._ Yes, how does your Lordship?

  _Mem._ Well, God a mercy Souldier, very well,
  But prithee tell me--

  _Si._ Any thing I can, Sir.

  _Mem._ What durst thou do to gain the rarest Beauty
  The World has?

  _Si._ That the World has? 'tis worth doing.

  _Mem._ Is it so; but what doing bears it?

  _Si._ Why! any thing; all danger it appears to.

  _Mem_. Name some of those things: do.

  _Si._ I would undertake, Sir,
  A Voyage round about the World.

  _Mem._ Short, _Siphax_.
  A Merchant does it to spice pots of Ale.

  _Si._ I wou'd swim in Armour.

  _Mem._ Short still; a poor Jade
  Loaden will take a stream and stem it strongly
  To leap a Mare.

  _Si._ The plague, I durst.

  _Mem._ Still shorter,
  I'll cure it with an Onion.

  _Si._ Surfeits.

  _Mem._ Short still:
  They are often Physicks for our healths, and help us.

  _Si._ I wou'd stand a breach.

  _Mem._ Thine honour bids thee, Souldier:
  'Tis shame to find a second cause.

  _Si._ I durst, Sir,
  Fight with the fellest Monster.

  _Mem._ That's the poorest,
  Man was ordain'd their Master; durst ye dye, Sir?

  _Si._ How? dye my Lord!

  _Mem._ Dye _Siphax_; take thy Sword,
  And come by that door to her; there's a price
  To buy a lusty love at.

  _Si._ I am content, Sir,
  To prove no Purchaser.

  _Mem._ Away thou World-worm,
  Thou win a matchless Beauty?

  _Si._ 'Tis to lose't Sir,
  For being dead, where's the reward I reach at?
  The love I labour for?

  _Mem._ There it begins Fool,
  Thou art meerly cozen'd; for the loves we now know
  Are but the heats of half an hour; and hated
  Desires stir'd up by nature to encrease her;
  Licking of one another to a lust;
  Course and base appetites, earths meer inheritours
  And Heirs of Idleness and blood; Pure Love,
  That, that the soul affects, and cannot purchase
  While she is loaden with our flesh, that Love, Sir,
  Which is the price of honour, dwells not here,
  Your Ladies eyes are lampless to that Vertue,
  That beauty smiles not on a cheek washt over,
  Nor scents the sweet of Ambers; below, _Siphax_
  Below us, in the other World _Elyzium_,
  Where's no more dying, no despairing, mourning,
  Where all desires are full, desarts down loaden,
  There _Siphax_, there, where loves are ever living.

  _Si._ Why do we love in this World then?

  _Mem._ To preserve it,
  The maker lost his work else; but mark _Siphax_,
  What issues that love bears.

  _Si._ Why Children, Sir.
  I never heard him talk thus; thus divinely
  And sensible before.

  _Mem._ It does so, _Siphax_,
  Things like our selves, as sensual, vain, unvented
  Bubbles, and breaths of air, got with an itching
  As blisters are, and bred, as much corruption
  Flows from their lives, sorrow conceives and shapes 'em,
  And oftentimes the death of those we love most.
  The breeders bring them to the World to curse 'em,
  Crying they creep amongst us like young Cats.
  Cares and continual Crosses keeping with 'em,
  They make Time old to tend them, and experience
  An ass, they alter so; they grow and goodly,
  Ere we can turn our thoughts, like drops of water
  They fall into the main, are known no more;
  This is the love of this World; I must tell thee
  For thou art understanding.

  _Si._ What you please, Sir.

  _Mem._ And as a faithful man:
  Nay I dare trust thee,
  I love the Princess.

  _Si._ There 'tis, that has fired him,
  I knew he had some inspiration.
  But does she know it, Sir?

  _Mem._ Yes marry does she,
  I have given my heart unto her.

  _Si._ If ye love her.

  _Mem._ Nay, understand me, my heart taken from me,
  Out of my Body, man, and so brought to her.
  How lik'st thou that brave offer? there's the love
  I told thee of; and after death, the living;
  She must in justice come Boy, ha?

  _Si._ Your heart, Sir?

  _Mem._ I, so by all means, _Siphax_.

  _Si._ He loves roast well
  That eats the Spit.

  _Mem._ And since thou art come thus fitly,
  I'll do it presently and thou shalt carry it,
  For thou canst tell a story and describe it.
  And I conjure thee, _Siphax_, by thy gentry,
  Next by the glorious Battels we have fought in,
  By all the dangers, wounds, heats, colds, distresses,
  Thy love next, and obedience, nay thy life.

  _Si._ But one thing, first, Sir, if she pleas'd to grant it,
  Could ye not love her here and live? consider.

  _Mem._ Ha? Yes, I think I could.

  _Si._ 'Twould be far nearer,
  Besides the sweets here would induce the last love
  And link it in.

  _Mem._ Thou sayest right, but our ranks here
  And bloods are bars between us, she must stand off too
  As I perceive she does.

  _Si._ Desert and Duty
  Makes even all, Sir.

  _Mem._ Then the King, though I
  Have merited as much as man can, must not let her,
  So many Princes covetous of her beauty;
  I wou'd with all my heart, but 'tis impossible.

  _Si._ Why, say she marry after.

  _Mem._ No, she dares not;
  The gods dare not do ill; come.

  _Si._ Do you mean it?

  _Mem._ Lend me thy knife, and help me off.

  _Si._ For heaven sake,
  Be not so stupid mad, dear General.

  _Mem._ Dispatch, I say.

  _Si._ As ye love that ye look for,
  Heaven and the blessed life.

  _Mem._ Hell take thee, Coxcomb,
  Why dost thou keep me from it? thy knife I say.

  _Si._ Do but this one thing, on my knees I beg it,
  Stay but two hours till I return again.
  For I will to her, tell her all your merits,
  Your most unvalu'd love, and last your danger;
  If she relent, then live still, and live loving,
  Happy, and high in favour: if she frown--

  _Mem._ Shall I be sure to know it?

  _Si._ As I live, Sir,
  My quick return shall either bring ye fortune,
  Or leave you to your own fate.

  _Mem._ Two hours?

  _Si._ Yes, Sir.

  _Mem._ Let it be kept, away, I will expect it.         [_Ex._ Mem. Si.

        _Enter_ Chilax, _Fool and Boy_.

  _Chi._ You dainty wits! two of ye to a Cater,
  To cheat him of a dinner?

  _Boy._ Ten at Court, Sir,
  Are few enough, they are as wise as we are.

  _Chi._ Hang ye, I'le eat at any time, and any where,
  I never make that part of want, preach to me
  What ye can do, and when ye list.

  _Fool._ Your patience,
  'Tis a hard day at Court, a fish day.

  _Chi._ So it seems, Sir,
  The fins grow out of thy face.

  _Fool._ And to purchase
  This day the company of one dear Custard,
  Or a mess of Rice ap _Thomas_, needs a main wit;
  Beef we can bear before us lined with Brewes
  And tubs of Pork; vociferating Veals,
  And Tongues that ne're told lye yet.

  _Chi._ Line thy mouth with 'em.

  _Fool._ Thou hast need, and great need,
  For these finny fish-dayes,
  The Officers understandings are so flegmatick,
  They cannot apprehend us.

  _Chi._ That's great pity,
  For you deserve it, and being apprehended
  The whip to boot; Boy what do you so near me?
  I dare not trust your touch Boy.

        _Enter_ Stremon _and his Boy_.

  _Boy._ As I am vertuous,
  What, thieves amongst our selves?

  _Chi._ _Stremon._

  _Stre._ Lieutenant.

  _Chi._ Welcome a shore, a shore.

  _Fool._ What _Mounsieur Musick_?

  _Stre._ My fine Fool.

  _Boy._ Fellow _Crack_, why what a consort
  Are we now blest withal?

  _Fool._ Fooling and fidling,
  Nay and we live not now boys; what new songs, Sirra?

  _Stre._ A thousand, man, a thousand.

  _Fool._ Itching Airs
  Alluding to the old sport.

  _Stre._ Of all sizes.

  _Fool._ And how does small _Tym Treble_ here; the heart on't?

  _2 Boy._ To do you service.

  _Fool._ O _Tym_ the times, the times _Tym_.

  _Stre._ How does the General,
  And next what money's stirring?

  _Chi._ For the General
  He's here, but such a General!
  The time's chang'd, _Stremon_,
  He was the liberal General, and the loving,
  The feeder of a Souldier, and the Father,
  But now become the stupid'st.

  _Stre._ Why, what ails he?

  _Chi._ Nay, if a Horse knew, and his head's big enough,
  I'le hang for't; did'st thou ever see a Dog
  Run mad o'th' tooth-ache, such another toy
  Is he now, so he glotes and grins, and bites.

  _Fool._ Why hang him quickly,
  And then he cannot hurt folks.

  _Chi._ One hour raving,
  Another smiling, not a word the third hour,
  I tell thee _Stremon_ h'as a stirring soul,
  What ever it attempts or labours at
  Would wear out twenty bodies in another.

  _Fool._ I'le keep it out of me, for mine's but Buckram,
  He would bownce that out in two hours.

  _Chi._ Then he talks
  The strangest and the maddest stuff from reason,
  Or any thing ye offer; stand thou there,
  I'le show thee how he is, for I'le play _Memnon_
  The strangest General that ere thou heardst of, _Stremon_.

  _Stre._ My Lord.

  _Chi._ Go presently and find me
  A black Horse with a blew tail; bid the blank Cornet
  Charge through the Sea, and sink the Navy: softly,
  Our souls are things not to be waken'd in us
  With larums, and loud bawlings, for in _Elyzium_
  Stilness and quietness, and sweetness, Sirra,
  I will have, for it much concerns mine honour,
  Such a strong reputation for my welcome
  As all the world shall say: for in the forefront
  So many on white Unicorns, next them
  My Gentlemen, my Cavaliers and Captains,
  Ten deep and trapt with Tenter-hooks to take hold
  Of all occasions: for Friday cannot fish out
  The end I aim at; tell me of _Diocles_,
  And what he dares do? dare he meet me naked?
  Thunder in this hand? in his left--Fool--

  _Fool._ Yes, Sir.

  _Chi._ Fool, I would have thee fly i'th' Air, fly swiftly
  To that place where the Sun sets, there deliver.

  _Fool._ Deliver? what, Sir?

  _Chi._ This Sir, this ye slave, Sir,                     [_All laugh._
  Death ye rude Rogues, ye Scarabe's.

  _Fool._ Hold for Heav'ns sake, Lieutenant, sweet Lieutenant.

  _Chi._ I have done, Sir.

  _Boy._ You have wrung his neck off.

  _Chi._ No Boy, 'tis the nature
  Of this strange passion when't hits to hale people
  Along by th' hair, to kick 'em, break their heads.

  _Fool._ Do ye call this Acting, was your part to beat me?

  _Chi._ Yes, I must act all that he does.

  _Fool._ Plague act ye,
  I'le act no more.

  _Stre._ 'Tis but to shew man.

  _Fool._ Then man
  He should have shew'd it only, and not done it,
  I am sure he beat me beyond Action,
  Gouts o' your heavy fist.

  _Chi._ I'le have thee to him,
  Thou hast a fine wit, fine fool, and canst play rarely.
  He'l hug thee, Boy, and stroke thee.

  _Fool._ I'le to the stocks first,
  E're I be strok't thus.

  _Strem._ But how came he, _Chilax_?

  _Chi._ I know not that.

  _Strem._ I'le to him.

  _Chi._ He loves thee well,
  And much delights to hear thee sing; much taken
  He has been with thy battel songs.

  _Stre._ If Musick
  Can find his madness; I'le so fiddle him,
  That out it shall by th' shoulders.

  _Chi._ My fine Fidler,
  He'l firk you and ye take not heed too: 'twill be rare sport
  To see his own trade triumph over him;
  His Lute lac'd to his head, for creeping hedges;
  For mony there's none stirring; try good _Stremon_
  Now what your silver sound can do; our voices
  Are but vain Echoes.

  _Stre._ Something shall be done
  Shall make him understand all; let's toth' Tavern,
  I have some few Crowns left yet: my whistle wet once
  I'le pipe him such a Paven--

  _Chi._ Hold thy head up,
  I'le cure it with a quart of wine; come Coxcomb,
  Come Boy take heed of Napkins.

  _Fool._ Youl'd no more acting?

  _Chi._ No more Chicken.

  _Fool._ Go then.                                      [_Exeunt omnes._

        _Enter_ Siphax _at one door, and a Gentleman at the other_.

  _Si._ God save you Sir; pray how might I see the Princess?

  _Gent._ Why very fitly, Sir, she's even now ready
  To walk out this way intoth' Park; stand there,
  Ye cannot miss her sight, Sir.

  _Si._ I much thank ye.                              [_Exit Gentleman._

        _Enter_ Calis, Lucippe, _and_ Cleanthe.

  _Cal._ Let's have a care, for I'le assure ye Wenches
  I wou'd not meet him willingly again;
  For though I do not fear him, yet his fashion
  I wou'd not be acquainted much with.

  _Cle._ Gentle Lady,
  Ye need not fear, the walks are view'd and empty,
  But me thinks, Madam, this kind heart of his--

  _Lucip._ He's slow a coming.

  _Si._ Keep me ye blest Angels,
  What killing power is this?

  _Cal._ Why, dost thou look for't?
  Dost think he spoke in earnest?

  _Lucip._ Methinks, Madam,
  A Gentleman should keep his word; and to a Lady,
  A Lady of your excellencies.

  _Cal._ Out Fool!
  Send me his heart? what should we do with't? dance it?

  _Lucip._ Dry it and drink it for the Worms.

  _Cal._ Who's that?
  What man stands there?

  _Clean._ Where?

  _Cal._ There.

  _Cle._ A Gentleman,
  Which I beseech your grace to honour so much,
  As know him for your servants Brother.

  _Cal._ _Siphax?_

  _Cle._ The same an't please your grace; what does he here?
  Upon what business? and I ignorant?

  _Cal._ He's grown a handsome Gentleman: good _Siphax_
  Y'are welcome from the Wars; wou'd ye with us, Sir?
  Pray speak your will: he blushes, be not fearfull,
  I can assure ye for your Sisters sake, Sir,
  There's my hand on it.

  _Cle._ Do you hear, Sir?

  _Cal._ Sure these Souldiers
  Are all grown senseless.

  _Cle._ Do ye know where ye are, Sir?

  _Cal._ Tongue-tyed,
  He looks not well too, by my life, I think--

  _Cle._ Speak for shame speak.

  _Lucip._ A man wou'd speak--

  _Cal._ These Souldiers
  Are all dumb Saints: consider and take time, Sir,
  Let's forward Wenches, come, his Palat's down.

  _Luc._ Dare these men charge i'th' face of fire and bullets?
  And hang their heads down at a handsome Woman?
  Good master _Mars_, that's a foul fault.         [_Ex. Prin._ Lucippe.

  _Cle._ Fye beast,
  No more my Brother.

  _Si._ Sister, honoured Sister.

  _Cle._ Dishonoured fool.

  _Si._ I do confess.

  _Cle._ Fye on thee.

  _Si._ But stay till I deliver.

  _Cle._ Let me go,
  I am asham'd to own thee.

  _Si._ Fare ye well then,
  Ye must ne're see me more.

  _Cle._ Why stay dear _Siphax_,
  My anger's past; I will hear ye speak.

  _Si._ O Sister!

  _Cle._ Out with it Man.

  _Si._ O I have drunk my mischief.

  _Cle._ Ha? what?

  _Si._ My destruction.
  In at mine eyes I have drunk it; O the Princess,
  The rare sweet Princess!

  _Cle._ How fool? the rare Princess?
  Was it the Princess that thou said'st?

  _Si._ The Princess.

  _Cle._ Thou dost not love her sure, thou darst not.

  _Si._ Yes by Heaven.

  _Cle._ Yes by Heaven? I know thou darst not.
  The Princess? 'tis thy life the knowledge of it,
  Presumption that will draw into it all thy kindred,
  And leave 'em slaves and succourless; the Princess?
  Why she's a sacred thing to see and worship,
  Fixt from us as the Sun is, high, and glorious,
  To be ador'd not doted on; desire things possible,
  Thou foolish young man, nourish not a hope
  Will hale thy heart out.

  _Si._ 'Tis my destinie,
  And I know both disgrace and death will quit it,
  If it be known.

  _Cle._ Pursue it not then, _Siphax_,
  Get thee good wholesome thoughts may nourish thee,
  Go home and pray.

  _Si._ I cannot.

  _Cle._ Sleep then, _Siphax_,
  And dream away thy doting.

  _Si._ I must have her,
  Or you no more your Brother; work _Cleanthe_,
  Work, and work speedily, or I shall die Wench.

  _Cle._ Dye then, I dare forget; farewel.

  _Si._ Farewel Sister.
  Farewel for ever, see me buried.

  _Cle._ Stay.
  Pray stay: he's all my brothers: no way _Siphax_,
  No other Woman?

  _Si._ None, none, she or sinking.

  _Cle._ Go and hope well, my life I'le venture for thee
  And all my art, a Woman may work miracles;
  No more, pray heartily against my fortunes,
  For much I fear a main one.

  _Si._ I shall do it.                                        [_Exeunt._




_Actus Tertius. Scena Prima._


        _Enter a Priestess of_ Venus _and a Boy_.

  _Pri._ Find him by any means; and good child tell him
  He has forgot his old friend, give him this,
  And say this night without excuse or business,
  As ever he may find a friend, come to me,
  He knows the way and how, begon.

  _Boy._ I gallop.                                          [_Exit Boy._

        _Enter_ Cleanthe.

  _Cle._ I have been looking you.

  _Pri._ The fair _Cleanthe_,
  What may your business be?

  _Cle._ O holy Mother
  Such business, of such strange weight, now or never.
  As ye have loved me, as ye do or may do,
  When I shall find a fit time.

  _Pri._ If by my means
  Your business may be fitted; ye know me,
  And how I am tyed unto you; be bold Daughter
  To build your best hopes.

  _Cle._ O but 'tis a strange one,
  Stuck with as many dangers--

  _Pri._ There's the working,
  Small things perform themselves and give no pleasures;
  Be confident, through death I'le serve.

  _Clea._ Here.

  _Pri._ Fye no corruption.

  _Cle._ Take it; 'tis yours,
  And goodness is no gall to th' Conscience,
  I know ye have ways to vent it: ye may hold it.

  _Pr._ I'll keep it for ye; when?

  _Cle._ To morrow morning
  I'll visit ye again; and when occasion
  Offers it self--

  _Pr._ Instruct me, and have at ye.

  _Cle._ Farewel till then; be sure.

  _Pri._ As your own thoughts, Lady.

  _Cle._ 'Tis a main work, and full of fear.                [_Exit Cle._

  _Pri._ Fools only
  Make their effects seem fearful, farewell daughter.
  This gold was well got for my old tuff Souldier,
  Now I shall be his sweet again; what business
  Is this she has a foot? some lusty lover
  Beyond her line, the young Wench would fain piddle,
  A little to revive her must be thought of,
  'Tis even so, she must have it; but how by my means,
  A Devil, can she drive it? I that wait still
  Before the Goddess, giving Oracle,
  How can I profit her? 'tis her own project,
  And if she cast it false, her own fault be it.         [_Exit_ Priest.

        _Enter_ Polydore, Eumenes, _Captains_, Stremon.

  _Pol._ Why, this is utter madness.

  _Eum._ Thus it is, Sir.

  _Pol._ Only the Princess sight?

  _1 Cap._ All we can judge at.

  _Pol._ This must be lookt to timely.

  _Eum._ Yes, and wisely.

  _Pol._ He does not offer at his life?

  _Eum._ Not yet, Sir,
  That we can hear of.

  _Pol._ Noble Gentlemen,
  Let me entreat your watches over him,
  Ye cannot do a worthier work.

  _2 Cap._ We came, Sir,
  Provided for that service.

  _Pol._ Where is _Chilax_?

  _Strem._ A little busie, Sir.

  _Pol._ Is the Fool and Boy here?

  _Strem._ They are, Sir.

        _Enter_ Memnon.

  _Pol._ Let 'em be still so; and as they find his humours.

  _Eumen._ Now ye may behold him.

  _Pol._ Stand close, and make no noise;
  By his eyes now, Gentlemen,
  I guess him full of anger.

  _Eumen._ Be not seen there.

  _Mem._ The hour's past long ago, he's false and fearful,
  Coward, go with thy Caitive soul, thou Cur Dog,
  Thou cold Clod, wild fire warm thee, monstrous fearful,
  I know the Slave shakes but to think on't.

  _Pol._ Who's that?

  _Eumen._ I know not, Sir.

  _Mem._ But I shall catch ye, Rascal,
  Your mangy Soul is not immortal here, Sir,
  Ye must dye, and we must meet; we must, maggot,
  Be sure we must, for not a Nook of Hell,
  Not the most horrid Pit shall harbour thee;
  The Devils tail sha'n't hide thee, but I'll have thee,
  And how I'll use thee! whips and firebrands:
  Tosting thy tail against a flame of wild fire,
  And basting it with Brimstone, shall be nothing,
  Nothing at all; I'll teach ye to be treacherous:
  Was never Slave so swing'd since Hell was Hell
  As I will swinge thy Slaves Soul; and be sure on't.

  _Pol._ Is this imagination, or some circumstance?
  For 'tis extream strange.

  _Eumen._ So is all he does, Sir.

  _Mem._ Till then I'll leave ye; who's there? where's the Surgeon?
  _Demagoras?_

  _Dem._ My Lord.

  _Mem._ Bring the Surgeon:
  And wait you too.

        _Enter_ Surgeon.

  _Pol._ What wou'd he with a Surgeon?

  _Eum._ Things mustring in his head: pray mark.

  _Mem._ Come hither,
  Have you brought your Instruments?

  _Sur._ They are within, Sir.

  _Mem._ Put to the doors a while there; ye can incise
  To a hairs breadth without defacing.

  _Sur._ Yes Sir.

  _Mem._ And take out fairly from the flesh.

  _Sur._ The least thing.

  _Mem._ Well come hither; take off my doublet,
  For look ye Surgeon, I must have ye cut
  My Heart out here, and handsomly: Nay, stare not,
  Nor do not start; I'll cut your throat else, Surgeon,
  Come swear to do it.

  _Sur._ Good Sir--

  _Mem._ Sirrah, hold him,
  I'll have but one blow at his head.

  _Sur._ I'll do it,
  Why what should we do living after you, Sir?
  We'll dye before if ye please.

  _Mem._ No, no.

  _Sur._ Living? hang living.
  Is there ne'r a Cat hole where I may creep through?
  Would I were in the _Indies_.                                [_Aside._

  _Mem._ Swear then, and after my death presently
  To kill your selves and follow, as ye are honest,
  As ye have faiths, and loves to me.

  _Dem._ We'll do it.

  _Eum._ Pray do not stir yet, we are near enough
  To run between all dangers.

  _Mem._ Here I am, Sir;
  Come, look upon me, view the best way boldly,
  Fear nothing, but cut home; if your hand shake, Sirrah,
  Or any way deface my heart i'th' cutting,
  Make the least scratch upon it; but draw it whole,
  Excellent fair, shewing at all points, Surgeon,
  The Honour and the Valour of the Owner,
  Mixt with the most immaculate love I send it,
  Look to't, I'll slice thee to the Soul.

  _Sur._ Ne'r fear, Sir,
  I'll do it daintily; would I were out once.

  _Mem._ I will not have ye smile, Sirrah, when ye do it,
  As though ye cut a Ladies Corn; 'tis scurvy:
  Do me it as thou dost thy Prayers, seriously.

  _Sur._ I'll do it in a dump, Sir.

  _Mem._ In a Dog, Sir,
  I'll have no dumps, nor dumplins; fetch your tools,
  And then I'll tell ye more.

  _Sur._ If I return
  To hear more, I'll be hang'd for't.

  _Mem._ Quick, quick.

  _Dem._ Yes Sir,
  With all the heels we have.              [_Exeunt_ Surgeon, Demagoras.

  _Eumen._ Yet stand.

  _Pol._ He'l do it.

  _Eum._ He cannot, and we here.

  _Mem._ Why when ye Rascals,
  Ye dull Slaves: will ye come, Sir? Surgeon, syringe,
  Dog-leach, shall I come fetch ye?

  _Pol._ Now I'll to him.
  God save ye honour'd Brother.

  _Mem._ My dear _Polydore_,
  Welcome from travel, welcome; and how do ye?

  _Pol._ Well Sir, would you were so.

  _Mem._ I am, I thank ye.
  You are a better'd man much, I the same still,
  An old rude Souldier, Sir.

  _Pol._ Pray be plain, Brother,
  And tell me but the meaning of this Vision,
  For to me it appears no more; so far
  From common Course and Reason.

  _Mem._ Thank thee, Fortune,
  At length I have found the man: the man must do it,
  The man in honour bound.

  _Pol._ To do what?

  _Mem._ Hark, for I will bless ye with the circumstance
  Of that weak shadow that appear'd.

  _Pol._ Speak on, Sir.                               [_Walks with him._

  _Mem._ It is no Story for all ears.

  _Pol._ The Princess?                                      [_Whispers._

  _Mem._ Peace and hear all.

  _Pol._ How?

  _Eum._ Sure 'tis dangerous
  He starts so at it.

  _Pol._ Your heart? do you know, Sir?

  _Mem._ Yes, Pray thee be softer.

  _Pol._ Me to do it?

  _Mem._ Only reserv'd, and dedicated.

  _Pol._ For shame, Brother,
  Know what ye are, a man.

  _Mem._ None of your _Athens_,
  Good sweet Sir, no Philosophy, thou feel'st not
  The honourable end, fool.

  _Pol._ I am sure I feel
  The shame and scorn that follows; have ye serv'd thus long
  The glory of your Country, in your Conquests?
  The envy of your Neighbours, in your Vertues?
  Rul'd Armies of your own, given Laws to Nations,
  Belov'd and fear'd as far as Fame has travell'd,
  Call'd the most fortunate and happy _Memnon_,
  To lose all here at home, poorly to lose it?
  Poorly, and pettishly, ridiculously
  To fling away your fortune? where's your Wisedom?
  Where's that you govern'd others by, discretion?
  Do's your Rule lastly hold upon your self? fie Brother,
  How ye are faln? Get up into your honour,
  The top branch of your bravery, and from thence,
  Look and behold how little _Memnon_ seems now.

  _Mem._ Hum! 'tis well spoken; but dost thou think young Scholar,
  The tongues of Angels from my happiness
  Could turn the end I aim at? no, they cannot.
  This is no Book-case, Brother; will ye do it?
  Use no more art, I am resolv'd.

  _P[o]l._ Ye may Sir
  Command me to do any thing that's honest,
  And for your noble end: but this, it carries--

  _Mem._ Ye shall not be so honour'd; live an Ass still,
  And learn to spell for profit: go, go study.

  _Eum._ Ye must not hold him up so, he is lost then.

  _Mem._ Get thee to School again, and talk of turnips,
  And find the natural Cause out, why a Dog
  Turns thrice about e're he lyes down: there's Learning.

  _Pol._ Come, I will do it now; 'tis brave, I find it,
  And now allow the reason.

  _Mem._ O do you so, Sir?
  Do ye find it currant?

  _Pol._ Yes, yes, excellent.

  _Mem._ I told ye.

  _Pol._ I was foolish: I have here too
  The rarest way to find the truth out; hark ye?
  Ye shall be rul'd by me.

  _Mem._ It will be: but--

  _Pol._ I reach it,
  If the worst fall, have at the worst; we'll both go.
  But two days, and 'tis thus; ha?

  _Mem._ 'Twill do well so.

  _Pol._ Then is't not excellent, do ye conceive it?

  _Mem._ 'Twill work for certain.

  _Pol._ O 'twill tickle her,
  And you shall know then by a line.

  _Mem._ I like it,
  But let me not be fool'd again.

  _Pol._ Doubt nothing,
  You do me wrong then, get ye in there private
  As I have taught ye; _Basta_.

  _Mem._ Work.                                           [_Exit_ Memnon.

  _Pol._ I will do.

  _Eum._ Have ye found the cause?

  _Pol._ Yes, and the strangest, Gentlemen,
  That e'r I heard of, anon I'll tell ye: _Stremon_
  Be you still near him to affect his fancy,
  And keep his thoughts off: let the Fool and Boy
  Stay him, they may do some pleasure too: _Eumenes_
  What if he had a Wench, a handsome Whore brought,
  Rarely drest up, and taught to state it?

  _Eum._ Well Sir.

  _Pol._ His cause is meerly heat: and made believe
  It were the Princess mad for him.

  _Eum._ I think
  'Twere not amiss.

  _1 Cap._ And let him kiss her.

  _Pol._ What else?

  _2 Cap._ I'll be his Bawd an't please you, young and wholesome
  I can assure ye he shall have.

  _Eum._ Faith let him.

  _Pol._ He shall, I hope 'twill help him, walk a little.
  I'll tell you how his case stands, and my project
  In which you may be mourners, but by all means
  Stir not you from him, _Stremon_.

  _Strem._ On our lives, Sir.                                 [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Priestess, _and_ Chilax.

  _Pri._ O y'are a precious man! two days in town
  And never see your old Friend?

  _Chi._ Prithee pardon me.

  _Pri._ And in my Conscience if I had not sent.

  _Chi._ No more, I would ha' come; I must.

  _Pri._ I find ye,
  God a mercy want, ye never care for me
  But when your Slops are empty.

  _Chi._ Ne'r fear that, Wench;
  Shall find good currant Coin still; Is this the old House?

  _Pri._ Have ye forgot it?

  _Chi._ And the door still standing
  That goes into the Temple?

  _Pri._ Still.

  _Chi._ The Robes too,
  That I was wont to shift in here?

  _Pri._ All here still.

  _Chi._ O ye tuff Rogue, what troubles have I trotted through!
  What fears and frights! every poor Mouse a Monster
  That I heard stir, and every stick I trod on,
  A sharp sting to my Conscience.

  _Pri._ 'Las poor Conscience.

  _Chi._ And all to liquor thy old Boots, Wench.

  _Pri._ Out Beast:
  How you talk!

  _Chi._ I am old, Wench,
  And talking to an old man is like a stomacher,
  It keeps his blood warm.

  _Pri._ But pray tell me--

  _Chi._ Any thing.

  _Pri._ Where did the Boy meet with ye? at a Wench sure?
  At one end of a Wench, a Cup of Wine, sure?

  _Chi._ Thou know'st I am too honest.

  _Pri._ That's your fault,
  And that the Surgeon knows.

  _Chi._ Then farewel,
  I will not fail ye soon.

  _Pri._ Ye shall stay Supper;
  I have sworn ye shall, by this ye shall.

  _Chi._ I will, Wench;
  But after Supper for an hour, my business.

  _Pri._ And but an hour?

  _Chi._ No by this kiss, that ended
  I will return and all night in thine Arms wench.

  _Pr._ No more, I'le take your meaning; come 'tis Supper time.
                                                              [_Exeunt._

        _Enter_ Calis, Cleanthe, Lucippe.

  _Calis._ Thou art not well.

  _Clean._ Your grace sees more a great deal
  Than I feel, (yet I lye) O Brother!

  _Cal._ Mark her,
  Is not the quickness of her eye consumed, wench?
  The lively red and white?

  _Lucip._ Nay she is much alter'd,
  That on my understanding, all her sleeps Lady
  Which were as sound and sweet--

  _Cle._ Pray do not force me,
  Good Madam, where I am not, to be ill,
  Conceit's a double sickness; on my faith your highness
  Is meer mistaken in me.                        { _A Dead March within
                                                 { of Drum and Sagbutts_
  _Cal._ I am glad on't.
  Yet this I have ever noted when thou wast thus,
  It still forerun some strange event: my Sister
  Died when thou wast thus last: hark hark, ho,
  What mournfull noise is this comes creeping forward?
  Still it grows nearer, nearer, do ye hear it?

        _Enter_ Polydor, _and Captains_, Eumenes _mourning_.

  _Lucip._ It seems some Souldiers funeral: see it enters.

  _C[a]l._ What may it mean?

  _Pol._ The Gods keep ye fair _Calis_.

  _Cal._ This man can speak, and well; he stands and views us;
  Wou'd I were ne'r worse look't upon: how humbly
  His eyes are cast now to the Earth! pray mark him
  And mark how rarely he has rankt his troubles:
  See now he weeps, they all weep; a sweeter sorrow
  I never look't upon, nor one that braver
  Became his grief; your will with us?

  _Pol._ Great Lady,                              [_Plucks out the Cup._
  Excellent beauty.

  _Cal._ He speaks handsomely.
  What a rare rhetorician his grief plaies!
  That stop was admirable.

  _Pol._ See, see thou Princess,
  Thou great commander of all hearts.

  _Cal._ I have found it,
  O how my soul shakes!

  _Pol._ See, see the noble heart
  Of him that was the noblest: see and glory
  (Like the proud God himself) in what thou hast purchas'd,
  Behold the heart of _Memnon_: does it start ye?

  _Cal._ Good gods, what has his wildness done?

  _Pol._ Look boldlie,
  You boldlie said you durst, look wretched woman,
  Nay flie not back fair follie, 'tis too late now,
  Vertue and blooming honour bleed to death here,
  Take it, the Legacie of Love bequeath'd ye,
  Of cruel Love a cruel Legacie;
  What was the will that wrought it then? can ye weep?
  Imbalm it in your truest tears
  If women can weep a truth, or ever sorrow sunk yet
  Into the soul of your sex, for 'tis a Jewel
  The worlds worth cannot weigh down,
  Take it Lady; And with it all (I dare not curse) my sorrows,
  And may they turn to Serpents.

  _Eumen._ How she looks
  Still upon him! see now a tear steals from her.

  _2 Capt._ But still she keeps her eye firm.

  _Pol._ Next read this,
  But since I see your spirit somewhat troubled
  I'le doe it for ye.

  _2 Capt._ Still she eyes him mainlie.

        _Goe happy heart for thou shalt lye_
        _Intomb'd in her for whom I dye_
        _Example of her cruelty._

        _Tell her if she chance to chide_
        _Me for slowness in her pride_
        _That it was for her I died._

        _If a tear escape her eye_
        _'Tis not for my memory_
        _But thy rights of obsequy._

        _The Altar was my loving breast,_
        _My heart the sacrificed beast,_
        _And I was my self the Priest._

        _Your body was the sacred shrine,_
        _Your cruel mind the power divine_
        _Pleas'd with hearts of men, not kine._

  _Eumen._ Now it pours down.

  _Pol._ I like it rarelie: Ladie.

  _Eumen._ How greedily she swallows up his language!

  _2 Capt._ Her eye inhabits on him.

  _Pol._ Cruel Ladie,
  Great as your beautie scornfull; had your power
  But equal poise on all hearts, all hearts perish't;
  But _Cupid_ has more shafts than one, more flames too,
  And now he must be open ey'd, 'tis Justice:
  Live to injoy your longing; live and laugh at
  The losses and the miseries we suffer;
  Live to be spoken when your crueltie
  Has cut off all the vertue from this Kingdom,
  Turn'd honour into earth, and faithful service.

  _Cal._ I swear his anger's excellent.

  _Pol._ Truth, and most tried love
  Into disdain and downfall.

  _Calis._ Still more pleasing.

  _Pol._ Live then I say famous for civil slaughters,
  Live and lay out your triumphs, gild your glories,
  Live and be spoken this is she, this Ladie,
  This goodly Ladie, yet most killing beautie;
  This with the two edg'd eyes, the heart for hardness
  Outdoing rocks; and coldness, rocks of Crystal.
  This with the swelling soul, more coy of Courtship
  Than the proud sea is when the shores embrace him;
  Live till the mothers find ye, read your story,
  And sow their barren curses on your beauty,
  Till those that have enjoy'd their loves despise ye,
  Till Virgins pray against ye, old age find ye,
  And even as wasted coals glow in their dying,
  So may the Gods reward ye in your ashes:
  But y'are the Sister of my King; more prophecies
  Else I should utter of ye, true loves and loyal
  Bless themselves ever from ye: so I leave ye.

  _Cal._ Prethee be angry still young man: good fair Sir
  Chide me again, what wou'd this man doe pleas'd,
  That in his passion can bewitch souls? stay.

  _Eumen._ Upon my life she loves him.

  _Calis._ Pray stay.

  _Pol._ No.

  _Cal._ I do command ye.

  _Pol._ No, ye cannot Ladie,
  I have a spell against ye, Faith and Reason,
  Ye are too weak to reach me: I have a heart too,
  But not for hawks meat Ladie.

  _Cal._ Even for Charity
  Leave me not thus afflicted: you can teach me.

  _Pol._ How can you Preach that Charity to others
  That in your own soul are an Atheist,
  Believing neither power nor fear? I trouble ye,
  The Gods be good unto ye.

  _Cal._ Amen.
