AESTHETICAL AND LITERARY.

I. _Of Literary Biography and Monuments_.

(_a_) _A Letter to a Friend of Robert Burns, 1816_.

P. 5, l. 1. James Gray, Esq. Wordsworth was justified in naming Gray a
'friend' of Burns. He was originally Master of the High School,
Dumfries, and associated with the Poet there. Transferred to the High
School of Edinburgh, he taught for well-nigh a quarter of a century with
repute. Disappointed of the Rectorship, he retired from Edinburgh to an
academy at Belfast. Later, having entered holy orders, he proceeded to
India as a chaplain in the East India Company's service. He was
stationed at Bhooj, in Cutch, near the mouth of the Indus; and the
education of the young Rao of that province having been intrusted to the
British Government, Gray was selected as his instructor--being the first
Christian honoured with such an appointment in the East. He died at his
post in 1830, deeply regretted. He was author of 'Cuna of Cheyd' and the
'Sabbath among the Mountains,' and many other things, original and
editorial. He left a MS. poem, entitled 'India,' and a translation of
the Gospels into the Cutch dialect of Hindoostanee. He will hold a niche
in literature as the fifteenth bard in the 'Queen's Wake' who sings of
'King Edward's Dream.' He married a sister of Mrs. Hogg.

P. 5, footnote. Peterkin was a laborious compiler; but his Lives of
Burns and Fergusson are written in the most high-flown and exaggerated
style imaginable. He died in 1847.

P. 5, l. 9. 'Mr. Gilbert Burns ... a favourable opportunity,' &c. This
excellent, common-sensed, and humble man's contributions to the later
impressions (1804, &c.) of Dr. Currie's edition of Burns are of
permanent value--very much more valuable than later brilliant
productions that have displaced them. In Peterkin's Burns there is a
letter from Gilbert Burns to him, dated September 29th, 1814.

P. 7. Verse-quotation from Burns. From 'Address to the Unco Guid, or the
Rigidly Righteous' (closing stanzas).

P. 15. Verse-quotation. From Burns' 'A Bard's Epitaph.'

P. 17, footnote. Long before Wordsworth, Thomas Watson, in his 'Epistle
to the Frendly Reader' prefixed to his [Greek: EKATOMPATHIA] (1582),
wrote: 'As for any _Aristarchus_, Momus, or Zoilus, if they pinch me
more than is reasonable, thou, courteous Reader, which arte of a better
disposition, shalt rebuke them in my behalfe; saying to the first
[Aristarchus], that my birdes are al of mine own hatching,' &c.

P. 21, ll. 30-37, Chatterton; ll. 38-40, &c., Michael Bruce. Both of the
suggested monuments have been raised; Chatterton's at Bristol, and
Bruce's over his grave. A photograph of the latter is given in our
quarto edition of his Poems.


II. _Upon Epitaphs_.

P. 27, l. 10. Camden. Here and throughout the quotations (modernised)
are from 'Remaines concerning Britain: their

Languages,
Names,
Surnames,
Allusions,
Anagrammes,
Armories,
Monies,
Empreses,
Apparell,
Artillarie,
Wise Speeches,
Proverbs,
Poesies,
Epitaphs.

Written by William Camden, Esquire, Clarenceux King of Armes, surnamed
the Learned. The sixth Impression, with many rare Antiquities never
before imprinted. By the Industry and Care of John Philpot, Somerset
Herald: and W.D. Gent. London, 1657, 4to. Epitaphes, pp. 355-409. It has
not been deemed necessary to point out the somewhat loose character of
the quotations from Camden by Wordsworth; nor, with so many editions
available, would it have served any good end to have given the places in
the 'Epitaphes.' While Wordsworth evidently read both Camden and Weever,
his chief authority seems to have been a book that appeared on the sale
of his library, viz. 'Wit's Recreations; containing 630 Epigrams, 160
_Epitaphs_, and variety of Fantasies and Fantastics, good for Melancholy
Humours. 1641.'

P. 27, l. 16. This verse-rendering of 'Maecenas' is by Wordsworth, not
Camden--the quotation from whom here ought to have been marked with an
inverted comma (') after _relictos_.

P. 27, l. 22. Weever. The title in full is as follows: 'Ancient Fvnerall
Monvments within the Vnited Monarchie of Great Britaine, Ireland, and
the Islands adiacent, with the dissolued Monasteries therein contained:
their Founders, and what eminent Persons have beene in the same
interred. As also the Death and Bvriall of Certaine of the Blood Royall,
the Nobilitie and Gentrie of these Kingdomes entombed in forraine
Nations. A work reuiuing the dead memorie of the Royal Progenie, the
Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Communaltie of these his Maiesties Dominions.
Intermixed and Illustrated with variety of Historicall observations,
annotations, and briefe notes, extracted out of approued Authors,
infallible Records, Lieger Bookes, Charters, Rolls, old Manuscripts, and
the Collections of iudicious Antiquaries. Whereunto is prefixed a
Discourse of Funerall Monuments. Of the Foundation and Fall of Religious
Houses. Of Religious Orders. Of the Ecclesiasticall estate of England.
And of other occurrences touched vpon by the way, in the whole passage
of these intended labours. Composed by the Studie and Trauels of John
Weever. Spe labor leuis. London. 1631, folio.' As with Camden,
Wordsworth quotes Weever from memory (apparently) throughout.

P. 27, l. 23. Query--'or fore-feeling'?

P. 32, l. 6. 'Pause, Traveller.' The 'Siste viator' was kept up long
after such roadside interments were abandoned. Crashaw's Epitaph for
Harris so begins; _e.g._ 'Siste te paulum, viator,' &c. (Works, vol. ii.
p. 378, Fuller Worthies' Library.)

P. 33. John Edwards; verse-quotation. Query--the author of 'Kathleen'
(1808), 'Abradates and Panthea' (1808), &c.?

P. 40. At close; verse-quotation. From Milton, Ep. W. Sh.

P. 41. Verse-heading. From Gray's 'Elegy.' _En passant_, be it noted
that on 1st June 1875, at Sotheby's, the original MS. of this Elegy was
sold for upwards of 300 guineas to Sir William Fraser.

P. 45, l. 28. Read 'mearely'=merrily, as 'merrely' onward.

P. 49. ll. 7-14. On these lines, alleged to have been written by
Montrose, see Dr. Hannah's 'Courtly Poets' (1870), p. 207, and numerous
references. It may be noted that in line 2 Wordsworth changes 'too
rigid' into 'so rigid;' and l. 7, 'trumpet' into 'trumpets.'

P. 49, ll. 30-2. Verse-quotation. Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' book vi. ll.
754-6.

P. 66 (bottom). Epitaph on Mrs. Clark--_i.e._ Mrs. Jane Clarke. In l.
1, Gray wrote, not 'the,' but 'this;' which in the light of the
criticism it is important to remember.

P. 73-75. Long verse-quotation. From the 'Excursion,' book vii. ll.
400-550. Note the 'Various Readings.'


III. _Essays, Letters, and Notes elucidatory and confirmatory of the
Poems_.

(_a_) _Of the Principles of Poetry and the 'Lyrical Ballads.'_

P. 85. Verse-quotation. From Gray's Poems, 'Sonnet on the Death of Mr.
Richard West.'

P. 99, l. 30. Sir Joshua Reynolds. For Wordsworth's critical verdict on
his literary work as well as his painting, see Letters in present
volume, pp. 153-157, _et alibi_.


(_c_) _Poetry as a study_.

P. 112, ll. 6-7. Quotation from Spenser, 'Fairy Queen,' b.i.c.i. st. 9,
l. 1.

P. 113, footnote. Hakewill. The work intended is 'An Apologie or
Declaration of the Power and Providence of God in the Government of the
World.' Oxford, 1627 (folio), and later editions. He was George
Hakewill, D.D., Archdeacon of Surrey. Died 1649.

P. 115, ll. 36-7. '1623 to 1664 ... only two editions of the Works of
Shakspeare.' The second folio of 1632 and that of 1663 (same as 1664)
are here forgotten, and also the abundant separate reprints of the
separate Plays and Poems.

P. 123, l. 6. Mr. Malcom Laing, a historian of Scotland 'from the Union
of the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms in the Reign of Queen Anne'
(4th edition, 1819, 4 vols.), who, in an exhaustive and drastic style,
disposed of the notorious 'Ossian' fictions of Macpherson.

P. 130, ll. 12-14. Verse-quotation. From the 'Prelude.'


(_d_) _Of Poetry as Observation and Description_.

P. 134, ll. 3-4 (at bottom). Verse-quotation. From 'A Poet's Epitaph'
(VIII. 'Poems of Sentiment and Reflection').

P. 136, ll. 7-8. Verse-quotation. From Shakspeare, 'Lear,' iv. 6.

P. 136, ll. 17-24. Verse-quotation. From Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' book
ii. ll. 636-43.

P. 139, ll. 10-11. Verse-quotation. Ibid. book vi. ll. 767-8.

P. 140, ll. 10-11. Verse-quotation. From Shakspeare, 'Lear,' iii. 2.

P. 141, ll. 1-2. Verse-quotation. Ibid. 'Romeo and Juliet,' i. 4.

P. 142, ll. 7-8. 12-13. Verse-quotation. From Milton, 'Paradise Lost,'
book ix. 1002-3.

P. 143. Long verse-quotation. Charles Cotton, the associate 'Angler' of
Walton 'for all time,' and of whom, as a Poet, Abp. Trench, in his
'Household Book of English Poetry,' has recently spoken highly yet
measuredly.

P. 152, footnote *. _Various Readings_. (1) 'Sonnet composed at--.' Such
is the current heading of this Sonnet in the Poems (Rossetti, p. 177).
In the MS. it runs, 'Written at Needpath (near Peebles), Mansion of the
Duke of Queensbury' (_sic_); and thus opens:

    'Now, as I live, I pity that great lord!
    Whom pure despite of heart,' &c.;

instead of,

    'Degenerate Douglas! oh, the unworthy lord!
    Whom mere,' &c.

(2) To the Men of Kent, October 1803. In l. 3, the MS. reads:

    'Her haughty forehead 'gainst the coast of France,'

for 'brow against.' Line 7, 'can' for 'may.' (3) 'Anticipation,' October
1803. Line 12 in MS. reads:

    'The loss and the sore prospect of the slain,'

for,

    'And even the prospect of our brethren slain.'

In l. 14:

    'True glory, everlasting sanctity,'

for,

    'In glory will they sleep and endless sanctity.'

P. 161, l. 22. 'Milton compares,' &c. In 'Paradise Lost,' ii. 636-7.

P. 163, l. 2. 'Duppa is publishing a Life of Michael Angelo,' &c. It
appeared in 1806 (4to); reprinted in Bohn's 'Illustrated Library.'

P. 163, footnote A. Alexander Wilson, who became the renowned
'Ornithologist' of America, was for years a 'pedlar,' both at home and
in the United States. His intellectual ability and genius would alone
have given sanction to Wordsworth's conception; but as simple
matter-of-fact, the class was a peculiarly thoughtful and observant one,
as the Biographies of Scotland show.

P. 167, ll. 30-1. 'A tale told,' &c. From Shakspeare, 'Macbeth,' v. 5.

P. 170, l. 34. 'Houbraken,' &c. Reissued from the old copper-plates.

P. 171, l. 30. 'I have never seen the works,' &c. In the Fuller
Worthies' Library I have collected the complete Poems of Sir John
Beaumont, 1 vol.

Pp. 178-9. Quotation (bottom). From Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' book iv.
ll. 604-9; but 'How' is inadvertently substituted for 'Now.'

P. 196, l. 35. John Dyer. Wordsworth's repeated recognition and lofty
estimate of Dyer recalls the fact that a collection of his many-sided
Writings is still a _desideratum_ that the present Editor of
Wordsworth's Prose hopes some day to supply--invited to the task of love
by a lineal descendant.


(_b_) _Of the Principles of Poetry and his own Poems_.

P. 211, ll. 24-5. Verse-quotation from Cowper: more accurately it reads:

    'The jay, the pie, and even the boding owl
    That hails the rising moon, have charms for me.'

('The Task,' b. i. ll. 205-6.)


IV. DESCRIPTIVE.

(_a_) _A Guide through the District of the Lakes_.

P. 217. It seems somewhat remarkable that Wordsworth nowhere mentions
the following work: 'Remarks made in a Tour from London to the Lakes of
Westmoreland and Cumberland in the Summer of MDCCXCI., originally
published in the _Whitehall Evening Post_, and now reprinted with
additions and corrections.... By A. Walker, Lecturer,' &c. 1792, 8vo.
Wordsworth could not have failed to be interested in the descriptions of
this overlooked book. They are open-eyed, open-eared, and vivid. I would
refer especially to the Letters on Windermere, pp. 58-60, and indeed all
on the Lakes. Space can only be found for a short quotation on Ambleside
(Letter xiii., August 18, 1791): 'We now leave Low Wood, and along the
verge of the Lake have a pleasing couple of miles to Ambleside. This is
a straggling little market-town, made up of rough-cast white houses, but
charmingly situated in the centre of three radiant vallies, _i.e._ all
issuing from the town as from a centre. This shows the propriety of the
Roman station situated near the west end of this place, called
Amboglana, commanding one of the most difficult passes in England....
Beautiful woods rise half-way up the sides of the mountains from
Ambleside, and seem wishful to cover the naked asperities of the
country; but the Iron Works calling for them in the character of
charcoal every fourteen or fifteen years, exposes the nakedness of the
country. Among these woods and mountains are many frightful precipices
and roaring cascades. In a still evening several are heard at once, in
various keys, forming a kind of savage music; one, half a mile above the
town in a wood, seems upwards of a hundred feet fall.--About as much
water as is in the New River precipitates itself over a perpendicular
rock into a natural bason, where it seems to recover from its fall
before it takes a second and a third tumble over huge stones that break
it into a number of streams. It suffers not this outrage quietly, for it
grumbles through hollow glens and stone cavities all the way, till it
meets the Rothay, when it quietly enters the Lake' (pp. 71-3). It is odd
that a book so matterful, and containing many descriptions equal to this
of Ambleside, should be so absolutely gone out of sight. It is a
considerable volume, and pp. 1-114 are devoted to the Lake region.
Walker, in 1787, issued anonymously 'An Hasty Sketch of a Tour through
Part of the Austrian Netherlands, &c.... By an English Gentleman.'

P. 264. Quotation from (eheu! eheu!) the still unpublished poem of
'Grasmere.'

P. 274. Quotation from Spenser, 'Fairy Queen,' b. iii. c. v. st. 39-40.
In st. 39, l. 8, 'puny' is a misprint for 'pumy' = pumice; in st. 40, l.
3, 'sang' similarly misreads 'song' = sung, or were singing.

P. 284. Verse-quotation. From 'Sonnet on Needpath Castle,' as _ante_.

P. 296, footnote A. Lucretius, ii. 772 seq.; and cf. v. 482 seq.

(_b_) _Kendal and Windermere Railway_.

P. 331. Quotation from Burns,--Verse-letter to William Simpson, st. 14.

P. 336. Is this from Dryden? G.

NOTE.

On these Notes and Illustrations, their sources and arrangement, &c.,
see our Preface, Vol. I. The star [*] marks those that belong to the
I.F. MSS. G.




1. *_Prefatory Lines_.

    'If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven,
    Then to the measure of that heaven-born light,
    Shine, POET, in thy place, and be content:'--

'Like an untended watch-fire,' &c. (l. 10): These Verses were written
some time after we had become resident at Rydal Mount; and I will take
occasion from them to observe upon the beauty of that situation, as
being backed and flanked by lofty fells, which bring the heavenly bodies
to touch, as it were, the earth upon the mountain-tops, while the
prospect in front lies open to a length of level valley, the extended
lake, and a terminating ridge of low hills; so that it gives an
opportunity to the inhabitants of the place of noticing the stars in
both the positions here alluded to, namely, on the tops of the
mountains, and as winter-lamps at a distance among the leafless trees.


2. *_Prelude to the Last Volume_. [As supra.]

These Verses were begun while I was on a visit to my son John at
Brigham, and finished at Rydal. As the contents of this Volume to which
they are now prefixed will be assigned to their respective classes when
my Poems shall be collected in one Vol., I should be at a loss where
with propriety to place this Prelude, being too restricted in its
bearing to serve as a Preface for the whole. The lines towards the
conclusion allude to the discontents then fomented thro' the country by
the Agitators of the Anti-Corn-Law League: the particular causes of such
troubles are transitory, but disposition to excite and liability to be
excited, are nevertheless permanent and therefore proper objects of the
Poet's regard.




I. POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH.


3. *_Extract from the Conclusion of a Poem, composed in anticipation of
leaving School_.

'Dear native regions,' &c. 1786. Hawkshead. The beautiful image with
which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was resting in
a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of
sycamores, which then extended their branches from the shore of the
promontory upon which stands the ancient and at that time the more
picturesque Hall of Coniston, the Seat of the Le Flemings from very
early times. The Poem of which it was the conclusion was of many hundred
lines, and contained thoughts and images most of which have been
dispersed through my other writings.


4. Of the Poems in this class, 'The Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive
Sketches' were first published in 1793. They are reprinted with some
alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their publication.

       *       *       *       *       *

This notice, which was written some time ago, scarcely applies to the
Poem, 'Descriptive Sketches,' as it now stands. The corrections, though
numerous, are not, however, such as to prevent its retaining with
propriety a place in the class of Juvenile Pieces.


5. *_An Evening Walk. Addressed to a Young Lady_. [III.]

The young lady to whom this was addressed was my sister. It was composed
at School and during my first two college vacations. There is not an
image in it which I have not observed; and, now in my seventy-third
year, I recollect the time and place where most of them were noticed. I
will confine myself to one instance.

    'Waving his hat, the shepherd from the vale
    Directs his wandering dog the cliffs to scale;
    The dog bounds barking mid the glittering rocks,
    Hunts where his master points, the intercepted flocks.'

I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the pass
of Dunmail Raise. Upon second thought, I will mention another image:

    'And fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines
    Its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines.'

This is feebly and imperfectly exprest; but I recollect distinctly the
very spot where this first struck me. It was on the way between
Hawkshead and Ambleside, and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was
important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness of
the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by
the poets of any age or country, so far as I was acquainted with them;
and I made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency. I could
not have been at that time above fourteen years of age. The description
of the swans that follows, was taken from the daily opportunities I had
of observing their habits, not as confined to the gentleman's park, but
in a state of nature. There were two pairs of them that divided the lake
of Esthwaite and its in-and-out-flowing streams between them, never
trespassing a single yard upon each other's separate domain. They were
of the old magnificent species, bearing in beauty and majesty about the
same relation to the Thames swan which that does to a goose. It was from
the remembrance of these noble creatures I took, thirty years after, the
picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of 'Dion.'
While I was a school-boy, the late Mr. Curwen introduced a little fleet
of these birds, but of the inferior species, to the Lake of Windermere.
Their principal home was about his own islands; but they sailed about
into remote parts of the lake, and either from real or imagined injury
done to the adjoining fields, they were got rid of at the request of the
farmers and proprietors, but to the great regret of all who had become
attached to them from noticing their beauty and quiet habits. I will
conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not
been confined to a particular walk, or an individual place; a proof (of
which I was unconscious at the time) of my unwillingness to submit the
poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance. The country
is idealized rather than described in any one of its local aspects.


FOOT-NOTES.


5a. _Intake_ (l. 49).

    'When horses in the sunburnt intake stood.'

The word _intake_ is local, and signifies a mountain-enclosure.


6. _Ghyll_ (l. 54).

    'Brightens with water-brooks the hollow ghyll.'

Ghyll is also, I believe, a term confined to this country; ghyll and
dingle have the same meaning.


7. Line 191.

    'Gives one bright glance, and drops behind the hill.'

From Thomson.


8. *_Lines written while sailing in a Boat at Evening_. [IV.]

1789. This title is scarcely correct. It was during a solitary walk on
the banks of the Cam that I was first struck with this appearance, and
applied it to my own feelings in the manner here expressed, changing the
scene to the Thames, near Windsor. This, and the three stanzas of the
following poem, 'Remembrance of Collins,' formed one piece; but upon the
recommendation of Coleridge, the three last stanzas were separated from
the other.

DEDICATION.

TO THE REV. ROBERT JONES, FELLOW OF ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.

DEAR SIR,--However desirous I might have been of giving you proofs of
the high place you hold in my esteem, I should have been cautious of
wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you, had not the
circumstance of our having been companions among the Alps seemed to give
this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which
your modesty might otherwise have suggested.

In inscribing this little work to you, I consult my heart. You know well
how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a
post-chaise, and two travellers plodding slowly along the road, side by
side, each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders.
How much more of heart between the two latter!

I am happy in being conscious that I shall have one reader who will
approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret. You they must
certainly interest, in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly
look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of
melancholy. You will meet with few images without recollecting the spot
where we observed them together; consequently, whatever is feeble in my
design, or spiritless in my colouring, will be amply supplied by your
own memory.

With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description
of some of the features of your native mountains, through which we have
wandered together, in the same manner, with so much pleasure. But the
sea-sunsets, which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd, Snowdon,
the chair of Idris, the quiet village of Bethgelert, Menai and her
Druids, the Alpine steeps of the Conway, and the still more interesting
windings of the wizard stream of the Dee, remain yet untouched.
Apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects, I
cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how
much affection and esteem

                 I am, dear Sir,
                   Most sincerely yours,
                        W. WORDSWORTH.

London, 1793.


10. *_Descriptive Sketches_.

1791-2. Much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks
upon the banks of the Loire, in the years 1791, 1792. I will only notice
that the description of the valley filled with mist, beginning 'In
solemn shapes,' &c. was taken from that beautiful region, of which the
principal features are Lungarn and Sarnen. Nothing that I ever saw in
Nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which I
have attempted, alas how feebly! to convey to others in these lines.
Those two lakes have always interested me, especially from bearing, in
their size and other features, a resemblance to those of the North of
England. It is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should
be so unhealthy as it is.

resorted to, from a hope of relief, by multitudes, from every corner of
the Catholic world, labouring under mental or bodily afflictions.


17. _Sourd_. 'Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!' (I.
618.) An insect so called, which emits a short melancholy cry, heard at
the close of the Summer evenings, on the banks of the Loire.


18. *_Lines left upon a Seat in a Yew-tree, which stands near the Lake
of Esthwaite, on a desolate Part of the Shore, commanding a beautiful
Prospect_.[VII.]

Composed in part at school at Hawkshead. The tree has disappeared, and
the slip of Common on which it stood, that ran parallel to the lake,
and lay open to it, has long been enclosed, so that the road has lost
much of its attraction. This spot was my favourite walk in the evenings
during the latter part of my school-time. The individual whose habits
and character are here given was a gentleman of the neighbourhood, a man
of talent and learning, who had been educated at one of our
universities, and returned to pass his time in seclusion on his own
estate. He died a bachelor in middle age. Induced by the beauty of the
prospect, he built a small summer-house on the rocks above the peninsula
on which the ferry-house stands. [In pencil here--Query, Mr. Nott?]

This property afterwards past into the hands of the late Mr. Curwen. The
site was long ago pointed out by Mr. West in his _Guide_ as the pride of
the Lakes, and now goes by the name of 'The Station.' So much used I to
be delighted with the view from it, while a little boy, that some years
before the first pleasure-house was built, I led thither from Hawkshead
a youngster about my own age, an Irish boy, who was a servant to an
itinerant conjuror. My motive was to witness the pleasure I expected the
boy would receive from the prospect of the islands below, and the
intermingling water. I was not disappointed; and I hope the fact,
insignificant as it may seem to some, may be thought worthy of note by
others who may cast their eye over these notes.


19. _Guilt and Sorrow; or Incidents upon Salisbury Plain_.[VIII.]

ADVERTISEMENT, PREFIXED TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS POEM, PUBLISHED IN
1842.

Not less than one-third of the following poem, though it has from time
to time been altered in the expression, was published so far back as the
year 1798, under the title of 'The Female Vagrant.' The extract is of
such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it here:
but it was necessary to restore it to its original position, or the rest
would have been unintelligible. The whole was written before the close
of the year 1794, and I will detail, rather as a matter of literary
biography than for any other reason, the circumstances under which it
was produced.

During the latter part of the summer of 1793, having passed a month in
the Isle of Wight, in view of the fleet which was then preparing for
sea off Portsmouth at the commencement of the war, I left the place with
melancholy forebodings. The American war was still fresh in memory. The
struggle which was beginning, and which many thought would be brought to
a speedy close by the irresistible arms of Great Britain being added to
those of the Allies, I was assured in my own mind would be of long
continuance, and productive of distress and misery beyond all possible
calculation. This conviction was pressed upon me by having been a
witness, during a long residence in revolutionary France, of the spirit
which prevailed in that country. After leaving the Isle of Wight, I
spent two days in wandering on foot over Salisbury Plain, which, though
cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it, had upon the
whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains.

The monuments and traces of antiquity, scattered in abundance over that
region, led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of those
remote times with certain aspects of modern society, and with
calamities, principally those consequent upon war, to which, more than
other classes of men, the poor are subject. In those reflections, joined
with particular facts that had come to my knowledge, the following
stanzas originated.

In conclusion, to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are
well acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say, that of
the features described as belonging to it, one or two are taken from
other desolate parts of England.


20. *_The Female Vagrant_.

I find the date of this is placed in 1792 in contradiction, by mistake,
to what I have asserted in 'Guilt and Sorrow.' The correct date is
1793-4. The chief incidents of it, more particularly her description of
her feelings on the Atlantic, are taken from life.


21. *_Guilt and Sorrow; or Incidents upon Salisbury Plain_. [VIII.]

Unwilling to be unnecessarily particular, I have assigned this poem to
the dates 1793 and 1794; but, in fact, much of the Female Vagrant's
story was composed at least two years before. All that relates to her
sufferings as a soldier's wife in America, and her condition of mind
during her voyage home, were faithfully taken from the report made to me
of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same trials,
and affected in the same way. Mr. Coleridge, when I first became
acquainted with him, was so much impressed with this poem, that it would
have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood; but the
Mariner's fate appeared to me so tragical, as to require a treatment
more subdued, and yet more strictly applicable in expression, than I had
at first given to it. This fault was corrected nearly fifty years
afterwards, when I determined to publish the whole. It may be worth
while to remark, that though the incidents of this attempt do only in a
small degree produce each other, and it deviates accordingly from the
general rule by which narrative pieces ought to be governed, it is not
therefore wanting in continuous hold upon the mind, or in unity, which
is effected by the identity of moral interest that places the two
personages upon the same footing in the reader's sympathies. My ramble
over many parts of Salisbury Plain put me, as mentioned in the preface,
upon writing this poem, and left upon my mind imaginative impressions
the force of which I have felt to this day. From that district I
proceeded to Bath, Bristol, and so on to the banks of the Wye; when I
took again to travelling on foot. In remembrance of that part of my
journey, which was in 1793, I began the verses,

    'Five years have passed,' &c.


22. _Charles Farish_.

    'And hovering, round it often did a raven fly.'

From a short MS. poem read to me when an undergraduate, by my
schoolfellow and friend, Charles Farish, long since deceased. The verses
were by a brother of his, a man of promising genius, who died young.
['Guilt and Sorrow,' st. ix. l. 9.]


23. *_The Forsaken. Poems founded on the Affections_. [XII.]

This was an overflow from the affliction of Margaret, and excluded as
superfluous there; but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to
account, by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel; my poetry
having been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort, a
charge which the next piece, beginning,

    'Lyre! though such power do in thy magic live!'

will scarcely tend to obviate. The natural imagery of these verses was
supplied by frequent, I might say intense, observation of the Rydal
Torrent. What an animating contrast is the ever-changing aspect of that,
and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks, to the monotonous tone
and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all the
summer long by glaciers and melting snows! A traveller, observing the
exquisite purity of the great rivers, such as the Rhone at Geneva, and
the Reuss at Lucerne, where they issue out of their respective lakes,
might fancy for a moment that some power in Nature produced this
beautiful change, with a view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings
which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads; but, alas! how soon
does that purity depart, before the influx of tributary waters that have
flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men.


24. *_The Borderers: a Tragedy_.

Of this dramatic work I have little to say in addition to the short
printed note which will be found attached to it. It was composed at
Racedown in Dorset, during the latter part of the year 1795, and in the
course of the following year. Had it been the work of a later period of
life, it would have been different in some respects from what it is now.
The plot would have been something more complex, and a greater variety
of characters introduced, to relieve the mind from the pressure of
incidents so mournful; the manners also would have been more attended
to. My care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the
characters, and the position in which the persons in the drama stood
relatively to each other, that the reader (for I never thought of the
stage at the time it was written) might be moved, and to a degree
instructed, by lights penetrating somewhat into the depths of our
nature. In this endeavour, I cannot think, upon a very late review, that
I have failed. As to the scene and period of action, little more was
required for my purpose than the absence of established law and
government, so that the agents might be at liberty to act on their own
impulses. Nevertheless, I do remember, that having a wish to colour the
manners in some degree from local history more than my knowledge enabled
me to do, I read Redpath's _History of the Borders_, but found there
nothing to my purpose. I once made an observation to Sir W. Scott, in
which he concurred, that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book
could be written on such a subject. Much about the same time, but a
little after, Coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of
_Remorse_; and it happened soon after that, through one of the Mr.
Pooles, Mr. Knight, the actor, heard that we had been engaged in writing
plays, and, upon his suggestion, mine was curtailed, and (I believe,
with Coleridge's) was offered to Mr. Harris, manager of Covent Garden.
For myself, I had no hope, nor even a wish (though a successful play
would in the then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of
good fortune), that he should accept my performance; so that I incurred
no disappointment when the piece was _judiciously_ returned as not
calculated for the stage. In this judgment I entirely concurred; and had
it been otherwise, it was so natural for me to shrink from public
notice, that any hope I might have had of success would not have
reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition. Mr. C.'s play was, as is
well known, brought forward several years after, through the kindness of
Mr. Sheridan. In conclusion, I may observe, that while I was composing
this play, I wrote a short essay, illustrative of that constitution and
those tendencies of human nature, which make the apparently _motiveless_
actions of bad men intelligible to careful observers. This was partly
done with reference to the character of Oswald, and his persevering
endeavour to lead the man he disliked into so heinous a crime; but still
more to preserve in my distinct remembrance what I had observed of
transitions in character, and the reflections I had been led to make,
during the time I was a witness of the changes through which the French
Revolution passed.


25. The following is the 'short printed note' mentioned in above:

This Dramatic Piece, as noticed in its title-page, was composed in
1795-6. It lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three
months unregarded among my papers, without being mentioned even to my
most intimate friends. Having, however, impressions upon my mind which
made me unwilling to destroy the MS., I determined to undertake the
responsibility of publishing it during my own life, rather than impose
upon my successors the task of deciding its fate. Accordingly it has
been revised with some care; but, as it was at first written, and is now
published, without any view to its exhibition upon the stage, not the
slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story, or the
composition of the characters; above all, in respect to the two leading
Persons of the Drama, I felt no inducement to make any change. The study
of human nature suggests this awful truth, that, as in the trial to
which life subjects us, sin and crime are apt to start from their very
opposite qualities, so are there no limits to the hardening of the
heart, and the perversion of the understanding to which they may carry
their slaves. During my long residence in France, while the Revolution
was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness, I had frequent
opportunities of being an eye-witness of this process, and it was while
that knowledge was fresh upon my memory that the Tragedy of the
_Borderers_ was composed.


26. Later, this was prefixed: 'Readers already acquainted with my Poems
will recognise, in the following composition, some eight or ten lines
which I have not scrupled to retain in the places where they originally
stood. It is proper, however, to add, that they would not have been used
elsewhere, if I had foreseen the time when I might be induced to publish
this Tragedy. February 28. 1842.'




II. POEMS REFERRING TO THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD.


27. *_My Heart leaps up when I behold_. [I.]

This was written at Grasmere, Town-End, 1804.


28. *_To a Butterfly_. [II.]

Grasmere, Town-End. Written in the Orchard, 1801. My sister and I were
parted immediately after the death of our mother, who died in 1777,
both being very young. [Corrected in pencil on opposite page--' March
1778.']


29. *_The Sparrow's Nest_, [III.]

The Orchard, Grasmere, Town-End, 1801. At the end of the garden of my
Father's house at Cockermouth was a high terrace that commanded a fine
view of the river Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. This was our favourite
play-ground. The terrace wall, a low one, was covered with closely-clipt
privet and roses, which gave an almost impervious shelter to birds that
built their nests there. The latter of these stanzas alludes to one of
these nests.


30. *_Foresight_, [IV.]

Also composed in the Orchard, Grasmere, Town-End.


31. *_Characteristics of a Child three Years old_. [V.]

Picture of my daughter Catharine, who died the year after. Written at
Allan-Bank, Grasmere, 1811.


32. *_Address to a Child_, [VI.]

During a boisterous Winter's Evening. Town-End, Grasmere, 1806.


33. *_The Mother's Return_, [VII.]

Ditto. By Miss Wordsworth [_i.e._ both poems].


34. *_Alice Fell; or Poverty_. [VIII.]

1801. Written to gratify Mr. Graham, of Glasgow, brother of the Author
of 'The Sabbath.' He was a zealous coadjutor of Mr. Clarkson, and a man
of ardent humanity. The incident had happened to himself, and he urged
me to put it into verse for humanity's sake. The humbleness, meanness if
you like, of the subject, together with the homely mode of treating it,
brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics, so that in
policy I excluded it from many editions of my Poems, till it was
restored at the request of some of my friends, in particular my
son-in-law, Edward Quillinan.


35. *_Lucy Gray; or Solitude_. [IX.]

Written at Goslar, in Germany, in 1799. It was founded on a
circumstance told me by my sister, of a little girl, who, not far from
Halifax, in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm. Her footsteps
were tracked by her parents to the middle of the lock of a canal, and no
other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body,
however, was found in the canal. The way in which the incident was
treated, and the spiritualising of the character, might furnish hints
for contrasting the imaginative influences, which I have endeavoured to
throw over common life, with Crabbe's matter-of-fact style of handling
subjects of the same kind. This is not spoken to his disparagement, far
from it; but to direct the attention of thoughtful readers into whose
hands these notes may fall, to a comparison that may enlarge the circle
of their sensibilities, and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment.

36. *_We are Seven_. [X.] _The Ancient Mariner and Coleridge, &c. &c._
&c.&c.

Written at Alfoxden in the spring of 1798, under circumstances somewhat
remarkable. The little girl who is the heroine, I met within the area of
Goderich Castle in the year 1793. Having left the Isle of Wight, and
crost Salisbury Plain, as mentioned in the preface to 'Guilt and
Sorrow,' I proceeded by Bristol up the Wye, and so on to N. Wales to the
Vale of Clwydd, where I spent my summer under the roof of the father of
my friend, Robert Jones.

In reference to this poem, I will here mention one of the most
remarkable facts in my own poetic history, and that of Mr. Coleridge. In
the spring of the year 1798, he, my sister, and myself, started from
Alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon, with a view to visit Linton, and
the Valley of Stones near to it; and as our united funds were very
small, we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem, to
be sent to the _New Monthly Magazine_, set up by Phillips, the
bookseller, and edited by Dr. Aikin. Accordingly we set off, and
proceeded, along the Quantock Hills, towards Watchet; and in the course
of this walk was planned the poem of the 'Ancient Mariner,' founded on a
dream, as Mr. Coleridge said, of his friend Mr. Cruikshank. Much the
greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention; but certain
parts I myself suggested; for example, some crime was to be committed
which would bring upon the Old Navigator, as Coleridge afterwards
delighted to call him, the spectral persecution, as a consequence of
that crime and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvocke's
_Voyages_, a day or two before, that, while doubling Cape Horn, they
frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of
sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet. 'Suppose,'
said I, 'you represent him as having killed one of these birds on
entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of these regions
take upon them to avenge the crime.' The incident was thought fit for
the purpose, and adopted accordingly. I also suggested the navigation of
the ship by the dead men, but do not recollect that I had anything more
to do with the scheme of the poem. The gloss with which it was
subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time,
at least not a hint of it was given to me, and I have no doubt it was a
gratuitous after-thought. We began the composition together, on that to
me memorable evening: I furnished two or three lines at the beginning of
the poem, in particular--

    'And listen'd like a three years' child;
      The Mariner had his will.'

These trifling contributions, all but one, (which Mr. C. has with
unnecessary scrupulosity recorded,) slipt out of his mind, as they well
might. As we endeavoured to proceed conjointly (I speak of the same
evening), our respective manners proved so widely different, that it
would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate
from an undertaking upon which I could only have been a clog. We
returned after a few days from a delightful tour, of which I have many
pleasant, and some of them droll enough, recollections. We returned by
Dulverton to Alfoxden. The 'Ancient Mariner' grew and grew till it
became too important for our first object, which was limited to our
expectation of five pounds; and we began to talk of a volume which was
to consist, as Mr. Coleridge has told the world, of Poems chiefly on
natural subjects, taken from common life, but looked at, as much as
might be, through an imaginative medium. Accordingly I wrote 'The Idiot
Boy,' 'Her Eyes are wild,' &c., and 'We are Seven,' 'The Thorn,' and
some others. To return to 'We are Seven,' the piece that called forth
this note:--I composed it while walking in the grove of Alfoxden. My
friends will not deem it too trifling to relate, that while walking to
and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last
line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr.
Coleridge and my sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added,
and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my
task was finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be
expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza, thus:

    'A little child, dear brother Jem.'

I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jem,' as being ludicrous; but we
all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin's name, who
was familiarly called Jem. He was the brother of the dramatist; and this
reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice.
The said Jem got a sight of the 'Lyrical Ballads' as it was going
through the press at Bristol, during which time I was residing in that
city. One evening he came to me with a grave face, and said,
'Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about to
publish. There is one poem in it which I earnestly entreat you will
cancel, for, if published, it will make you everlastingly ridiculous.' I
answered, that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good
name as a writer, and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he
alluded to. He said, 'It is called "We are Seven."' 'Nay,' said I, 'that
shall take its chance, however;' and he left me in despair. I have only
to add, that in the spring of 1841, I visited Goodrich Castle, not
having seen that part of the Wye since I met the little girl there in
1793. It would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the
neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much, but
that was impossible, as, unfortunately, I did not even know her name.
The ruin, from its position and features, is a most impressive object. I
could not but deeply regret that its solemnity was impaired by a
fantastic new castle set up on a projection of the same ridge, as if to
show how far modern art can go in surpassing all that could be done by
antiquity and Nature with their united graces, remembrances, and
associations. I could have almost wished for power, so much the contrast
vexed me, to blow away Sir ---- Meyrick's impertinent structure and all
the possessions it contains.


37. *_The Idle Shepherd Boys; or Dungeon-Ghyll Force: a Pastoral_. [XI.]

Grasmere, Town-End, 1800. I will only add a little monitory anecdote
concerning this subject. When Coleridge and Southey were walking
together upon the Fells, Southey observed that, if I wished to be
considered a faithful painter of rural manners, I ought not to have said
that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the
poem. Just as the words had past his lips, two boys appeared with the
very plant entwined round their hats. I have often wondered that
Southey, who rambled so much about the mountains, should have fallen
into this mistake; and I record it as a warning for others who, with far
less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are, and
with far less sagacity, give way to presumptuous criticism, from which
he was free, though in this matter mistaken. In describing a tarn under
Helvellyn, I say,

    'There sometimes doth a leaping fish
    Send through the tarn a lonely cheer.'

This was branded by a critic of those days, in a review ascribed to Mrs.
Barbauld, as unnatural and absurd. I admire the genius of Mrs. Barbauld,
and am certain that, had her education been favourable to imaginative
influences, no female of her day would have been more likely to
sympathise with that image, and to acknowledge the truth of the
sentiment.


38. _Foot-note_.

Heading: 'Dungeon-ghyll Force.' _Ghyll_, in the dialect of Cumberland
and Westmoreland, is a short and, for the most part, a steep narrow
valley, with a stream running through it. _Force_ is the word
universally employed in these dialects for waterfall.


39. *_Anecdote for Fathers_. [XII.]

This was suggested in front of Alfoxden. The boy was a son of my friend
Basil Montagu, who had been two or three years under our care. The name
of Kilve is from a village in the Bristol Channel, about a mile from
Alfoxden; and the name of Liswin Farm was taken from a beautiful spot on
the Wye. When Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and I had been visiting the
famous John Thelwall, who had taken refuge from politics, after a trial
for high treason, with a view to bring up his family by the profits of
agriculture; which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had
fled from. Coleridge and he had been public lecturers: Coleridge
mingling with his politics theology; from which the other abstained,
unless it were for the sake of a sneer. This quondam community of public
employment induced Thelwall to visit Coleridge at Nether Stowey, where
he fell in my way. He really was a man of extraordinary talent, an
affectionate husband, and a good father. Though brought up in the city
on a tailor's board, he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural
objects. I remember once when Coleridge, he and I were seated together
upon the turf, on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of
the most beautiful glen of Alfoxden, Coleridge exclaimed, 'This is a
place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide
world.' 'Nay,' said Thelwall, 'to make one forget them altogether.' The
visit of this man to Coleridge was, as I believe Coleridge has related,
the occasion of a spy being sent by Government to watch our proceedings;
which were, I can say with truth, such as the world at large would have
thought ludicrously harmless.


40. _Rural Architecture_. [XIII.]

These structures, as every one knows, are common among our hills, being
built by shepherds, as conspicuous marks, and occasionally by boys in
sport. It was written at Town-End, in 1801.


41. _Foot-note: Great How_ (l. 4).

Great How is a single and conspicuous hill, which rises towards the foot
of Thirlmere, on the western side of the beautiful dale of
Legberthwaite.


42. *_The Pet Lamb: a Pastoral_. [XIV.]

Town-End, 1800. Barbara Lewthwaite, now living at Ambleside (1843),
though much changed as to beauty, was one of two most lovely sisters.
Almost the first words my poor brother John said, when he visited us for
the first time at Grasmere, were, 'Were those two angels that I have
just seen?' and from his description I have no doubt they were those
two sisters. The mother died in childbed; and one of our neighbours, at
Grasmere, told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that
mother as she lay in her coffin with her [dead] babe in her arm. I
mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom, once
universal in these vales: every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to
look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed, which was
never done (nor I believe is now) till a minute or two before the corpse
was removed. Barbara Lewthwaite was not, in fact, the child whom I had
seen and overheard as engaged in the poem. I chose the name for reasons
implied in the above, and will here add a caution against the use of
names of living persons. Within a few months after the publication of
this poem, I was much surprised, and more hurt, to find it in a child's
school-book, which, having been compiled by Lindley Murray, had come
into use at Grasmere school, where Barbara was a pupil. And, alas, I had
the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of being thus
distinguished; and in after life she used to say that she remembered the
incident, and what I said to her upon the occasion.


43. *_Influence of Natural Objects, &c._ [XVI.]

Written in Germany, 1799.


44. *_The Longest Day_. [XVII.]

1817. Suggested by the sight of my daughter (Dora) playing in front of
Rydal Mount, and composed in a great measure the same afternoon. I have
often wished to pair this poem upon the 'longest' with one upon the
'shortest' day, and regret even now that it has not been done.


45. *_The Norman Boy_. [XVIII.]

The subject of this poem was sent me by Mrs. Ogle, to whom I was
personally unknown, with a hope on her part that I might be induced to
relate the incident in verse. And I do not regret that I took the
trouble; for not improbably the fact is illustrative of the boy's early
piety, and may concur, with my other little pieces on children, to
produce profitable reflection among my youthful readers. This is said,
however, with an absolute conviction that children will derive most
benefit from books which are not unworthy the perusal of persons of any
age. I protest with my whole heart against those productions, so
abundant in the present day, in which the doings of children are dwelt
upon as if they were incapable of being interested in anything else. On
this subject I have dwelt at length in the Poem on the growth of my own
mind. ['Prelude.']

III. POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS.


46. _The Brothers_. [I.]

1800. This poem was composed in a grove at the north-eastern end of
Grasmere Lake, which grove was in a great measure destroyed by turning
the high-road along the side of the water. The few trees that are left
were spared at my intercession. The poem arose out of the fact mentioned
to me, at Ennerdale, that a shepherd had fallen asleep upon the top of
the rock called the 'pillar,' and perished as here described, his staff
being left midway on the rock.


47. _Great Gavel_. (Foot-note.)

'From the Great Gavel down by Leeza's banks' (l. 324).

The Great Gavel, so called, I imagine, from its resemblance to the gable
end of a house, is one of the highest of the Cumberland mountains. The
Leeza is a river which flows into the Lake of Ennerdale.


48. _Artegal and Elidure_. [II.]

Rydal Mount. This was written in the year 1815, as a token of
affectionate respect for the memory of Milton. 'I have determined,' says
he, in his preface to his History of England, 'to bestow the telling
over even of these reputed tales, be it for nothing else but in favour
of our English Poets and Rhetoricians, who by their wit well know how to
use them judiciously.' See the Chronicle of Geoffrey of Monmouth and
Milton's History of England.


49. *_To a Butterfly_. [III.]

1801. Written at the same time and place.


50 *_A Farewell_. [IV.]

1802. Composed just before my sister and I went to fetch Mary from
Gallowhill, near Scarborough.


51. *_Stanzas written in my Pocket-copy of Thomson's 'Castle of
Indolence.'_ [V.]

Composed in the Orchard, Grasmere, Town-End. Coleridge living with us
much at the time, his son Hartley has said that his father's character
and history are here preserved in a livelier way than in anything that
has been written about him.


52. *_Louisa. After accompanying her on a mountain Excursion_. [VI.]

Town-End, 1805.


53. *_Strange Fits of Passion have I known_. [VII.]
    *_She dwelt among the Springs of Dove_. [VIII.]
    *_I travelled among unknown Men_. [IX.]

These three poems were written in Germany, 1799.


54. *_Ere with cold Beads of midnight Dew_. [X.]

Rydal Mount, 1826. Suggested by the condition of a friend.


55. *_To_ ----. [XI.]

Rydal Mount, 1824. Prompted by the undue importance attached to personal
beauty by some dear friends of mine. [In opposite page in pencil--S. C.]


56. *_'Tis said that some have died for Love_. [XIII.]

1800.


57. *_A Complaint_. [XIV.]

Suggested by a change in the manners of a friend. Coleorton, 1806.
[Town-End marked out and Coleorton written in pencil; and on opposite
page in pencil--Coleridge, S. T.]


58. *_To_ ----. [XV.]

Rydal Mount, 1824. Written on [Mrs.] Mary Wordsworth.


59. * '_How rich that Forehead's calm Expanse_!'[XVII.]

Rydal Mount, 1824. Also on M. W.


60. *_To_ ----. [XIX]

Rydal Mount, 1824. To M. W., Rydal Mount.


61. *_Lament of Mary Queen of Scots_. [XX.]

This arose out of a flash of Moonlight that struck the ground when I was
approaching the steps that lead from the garden at Rydal Mount to the
front of the house. 'From her sunk eye a stagnant tear stole forth,' is
taken, with some loss, from a discarded poem, 'The Convict,' in which
occurred, when he was discovered lying in the cell, these lines:

    'But now he upraises the deep-sunken eye;
      The motion unsettles a tear;
    The silence of sorrow it seems to supply,
      And asks of me, why I am here.'


62. _The Complaint of a forsaken Indian Woman_. [XXI.]

When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his journey
with his companions, he is left behind, covered over with deer-skins,
and is supplied with water, food, and fuel, if the situation of the
place will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions
intend to pursue, and if he be unable to follow, or overtake them, he
perishes alone in the desert; unless he should have the good fortune to
fall in with some other tribes of Indians. The females are equally, or
still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting work,
Hearne's _Journey from Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean_. In the high
northern latitudes, as the same writer informs us, when the northern
lights vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a
crackling noise, as alluded to in the following poem.


63. *_Ibid._

At Alfoxden, in 1798, where I read Hearne's _Journey_ with great
interest. It was composed for the volume of 'Lyrical Ballads.'


64. *_The Last of the Flock_. [XXII.]

Produced at the same time [as 'The Complaint,' No. 62] and for the same
purpose. The incident occurred in the village of Holford, close by
Alfoxden.


65. *_Repentance_ [XXIII.]

Town-End, 1804. Suggested by the conversation of our next neighbour,
Margaret Ashburner.


66. *_The Affliction of Margaret_ ----. [XXIV.]

Town-End, 1804. This was taken from the case of a poor widow who lived
in the town of Penrith. Her sorrow was well known to Mary, to my sister,
and I believe to the whole town. She kept a shop, and when she saw a
stranger passing by, she was in the habit of going out into the street
to inquire of him after her son.


67. *_The Cottager to her Infant_. [XXV.]

By my sister. Suggested to her while beside my sleeping children.


68. *_Maternal Grief_.

This was in part an overflow from the Solitary's description of his own
and his wife's feelings upon the decease of their children; and I will
venture to add, for private notice solely, is faithfully set forth from
my wife's feelings and habits after the loss of our two children, within
half a year of each other.


69. *_The Sailor's Mother_. [XXVII.]

Town-End, 1800. I met this woman near the Wishing-Gate, on the high-road
that then led from Grasmere to Ambleside. Her appearance was exactly as
here described, and such was her account, nearly to the letter.


70. *_The Childless Father_. [XXVIII.]

Town-End, 1800. When I was a child at Cockermouth, no funeral took place
without a basin filled with sprigs of boxwood being placed upon a table
covered with a white cloth in front of the house. The huntings (on foot)
which the Old Man is suffered to join as here described were of common,
almost habitual, occurrence in our vales when I was a boy; and the
people took much delight in them. They are now less frequent.


71. _Funeral Basin_.

     'Filled the funeral basin at Timothy's door.'

In several parts of the North of England, when a funeral takes place, a
basin full of sprigs of boxwood is placed at the door of the house from
which the coffin is taken up, and each person who attends the funeral
ordinarily takes a sprig of this boxwood, and throws it into the grave
of the deceased.


72. *_The Emigrant Mother_. [XXIX.]

1802. Suggested by what I have noticed in more than one French fugitive
during the time of the French Revolution. If I am not mistaken, the
lines were composed at Sockburn when I was on a visit to Mary and her
brothers.


73. _Vaudracour and Julia_. [XXX.]

The following tale was written as an Episode, in a work from which its
length may perhaps exclude it. The facts are true; no invention as to
these has been exercised, as none was needed.


74. *_Ibid._

Town-End, 1805. Faithfully narrated, though with the omission of many
pathetic circumstances, from the mouth of a French lady, who had been an
eye and ear-witness of all that was done and said. Many long years after
I was told that Dupligne was then a monk in the Convent of La Trappe.


75. _The Idiot Boy_.

Alfoxden, 1798. The last stanza, 'The cocks did crow, and the sun did
shine so cold,' was the foundation of the whole. The words were
reported to me by my dear friend Thomas Poole; but I have since heard
the same reported of other idiots. Let me add, that this long poem was
composed in the groves of Alfoxden, almost extempore; not a word, I
believe, being corrected, though one stanza was omitted. I mention this
in gratitude to those happy moments, for, in truth, I never wrote
anything with so much glee.


76. *_Michael_. [XXXII.]

Town-End, 1807. Written about the same time as 'The Brothers.' The
sheepfold on which so much of the poem turns, remains, or rather the
ruins of it. The character and circumstances of Luke were taken from a
family to whom had belonged, many years before, the house we lived in at
Town-End, along with some fields and woodlands on the eastern shore of
Grasmere. The name of the Evening Star was not in fact given to this
house, but to another on the same side of the valley more to the north.
[On opposite page in pencil--' Greenhead Ghyll.']


77. _Clipping_.

     'The Clipping Tree, a name which yet it bears' (foot-note on 1.
     169).

Clipping is the word used in the North of England for shearing.


78. *_The Widow on Windermere Side_. [XXXIV.]

The facts recorded in this Poem were given me and the character of the
person described by my highly esteemed friend the Rev. R.P. Graves, who
has long officiated as Curate at Bowness, to the great benefit of the
parish and neighbourhood. The individual was well known to him. She died
before these Verses were composed. It is scarcely worth while to notice
that the stanzas are written in the sonnet-form; which was adopted when
I thought the matter might be included in 28 lines.


79. _The Armenian Lady's Love_. [XXXIV.]

The subject of the following poem is from the 'Orlandus' of the author's
friend, Kenelm Henry Digby: and the liberty is taken of inscribing it to
him as an acknowledgment, however unworthy, of pleasure and instruction
derived from his numerous and valuable writings, illustrative of the
piety and chivalry of the olden time. *Rydal Mount, 1830.


80. _Percy's 'Reliques'_ (foot-note on 1. 2).

    'You have heard "a Spanish Lady
    How she wooed an English man."'

See in Percy's _Reliques_ that fine old ballad, 'The Spanish Lady's
Love'; from which Poem the form of stanza, as suitable to dialogue, is
adopted.


81. *_Loving and Liking_. [XXXV.]

By my Sister. Rydal Mount, 1832. It arose, I believe, out of a casual
expression of one of Mr. Swinburne's children.


82. *_Farewell Lines_. [XXXVI.]

These Lines were designed as a farewell to Charles Lamb and his Sister,
who had retired from the throngs of London to comparative solitude in
the village of Enfield, Herts, [_sic._]


83. (1) _The Redbreast_.

Lines 45-6.

    'Of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John
    Blessing the bed she lies upon.'

The words--

    'Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John,
    Bless the bed that I lie on,'

are part of a child's prayer still in general use through the northern
counties.


84. *(2)

Rydal Mount, 1834. Our cats having been banished the house, it was soon
frequented by Red-breasts. Two or three of them, when the window was
open, would come in, particularly when Mary was breakfasting alone, and
hop about the table picking up the crumbs. My Sister being then confined
to her room by sickness, as, dear creature, she still is, had one that,
without being caged, took up its abode with her, and at night used to
perch upon a nail from which a picture had hung. It used to sing and fan
her face with its wings in a manner that was very touching. [In
pencil--- But who was the pale-faced child?]


85. *_Her Eyes are wild_. [XXXVIII.]

Alfoxden, 1798. The subject was reported to me by a lady of Bristol, who
had seen the poor creature.

IV. POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES.


86. _Advertisement_.

By persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects, many
places will be found unnamed or of unknown names, where little Incidents
must have occurred, or feelings been experienced, which will have given
to such places a private and peculiar interest. From a wish to give some
sort of record to such Incidents, and renew the gratification of such
feelings, Names have been given to Places by the Author and some of his
Friends, and the following Poems written in consequence.


87. *_It was an April Morn, &c._ [I.]

Grasmere, 1800. This poem was suggested on the banks of the brook that
runs through Easedale, which is, in some parts of its course, as wild
and beautiful as brook can be. I have composed thousands of verses by
the side of it.


88. *'_May call it Emmas Dell'_ (I. 47).

[In pencil, with reference to the last line is this--Emma's Dell--Who
was Emma?]

89. *_To Joanna Hutchinson_. [II.]

Grasmere, 1800. The effect of her laugh is an extravagance; though the
effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of these mountains
is very striking. There is, in 'The Excursion,' an allusion to the bleat
of a lamb thus re-echoed and described, without any exaggeration, as I
heard it on the side of Stickle Tarn, from the precipice that stretches
on to Langdale Pikes.

90. _Inscriptions_.

In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native
rock, which, from the wasting of time, and the rudeness of the
workmanship, have been mistaken for Runic. They are without doubt Roman.
The Rotha mentioned in the poem is the River which, flowing through the
lakes of Grasmere and Ryedale, falls into Wynandermere. On Helmcrag,
that impressive single mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is
a rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an
old woman cowering. Close by this rock is one of those fissures or
caverns which in the language of the country are called dungeons. Most
of the mountains here mentioned immediately surround the Vale of
Grasmere; of the others, some are at a considerable distance, but they
belong to the same cluster.


91. *_There is an Eminence, &c._ [III.]

1800. It is not accurate that the eminence here alluded to could be seen
from our orchard seat. It arises above the road by the side of Grasmere
Lake, towards Keswick, and its name is Stone Arthur.


92. *'_A narrow Girdle of rough Stones and Crags'_ [IV.]

    '----Point Kash Judgment' (last line).

1800. The character of the eastern shore of Grasmere Lake is quite
changed since these verses were written, by the public road being
carried along its side. The friends spoken of were Coleridge and my
sister, and the fact occurred strictly as recorded.


93. *_To Mary Hutchinson_. [V.]

Two years before our marriage. The pool alluded to is in Rydal Upper
Park.


94. *_When to the Attractions, &c._ [VI.]

1805. The grove still exists; but the plantation has been walled in, and
is not so accessible as when my brother John wore the path in the manner
here described. The grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we
lived at Town-End.


95. _Captain Wordsworth_.

    'When we, and others whom we love, shall meet
    A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale' (last lines).

This wish was not granted; the lamented Person not long after perished
by shipwreck, in discharge of his duty as Commander of the Honourable
East India Company's Vessel, the Earl of Abergavenny.




V. POEMS OF THE FANCY.


96. *_A Morning Exercise_. [I.]

Rydal Mount, 1825. I could wish the last five stanzas of this to be read
with the poem addressed to the Skylark. [No. 158.]


97. *_Birds_.

'A feathered task-master cries, "Work away!" And, in thy iteration,
"Whip Poor Will!" Is heard the spirit of a toil-worn slave' (II. 15-17).

See Waterton's _Wanderings in South America_.


98. *_A Flower-garden_. [II.]

Planned by my friend Lady Beaumont in connexion with the garden at
Coleorton.


99. *_A Whirl-blast from behind the Hill_. [III.]

Observed in the holly grove at Alfoxden, where these verses were written
in the spring of 1799. I had the pleasure of again seeing, with dear
friends, this Grove in unimpaired beauty forty-one years after. [The
'dear friends' were Mrs. Wordsworth, Miss Fenwick, Mr. and Mrs.
Quillinan, and Mr. William Wordsworth, May 18, 1841. _Memoirs_, i. 112.]


100. *_The Waterfall and the Eglantine_. [IV.]

Suggested nearer to Grasmere on the same mountain track. The eglantine
remained many years afterwards, but is now gone. [In pencil on opposite
page--Mr. W. shewed me the place 1848. E.Q.]

101. *_The Oak and the Broom; a Pastoral_. [V.]

1800. Suggested upon the mountain pathway that leads from Upper Rydal to
Grasmere. The ponderous block of stone, which is mentioned in the poem,
remains, I believe, to this day, a good way up Nab-Scar. Broom grows
under it, and in many places on the side of the precipice.


102. *_To a Sexton_. [VI.]

Written in Germany, 1799.


103. *_To the Daisy_. [VII.]

This Poem, and two others to the same flower, were written in the year
1802; which is mentioned, because in some of the ideas, though not in
the manner in which those ideas are connected, and likewise even in some
of the expressions, there is a resemblance to passages in a Poem (lately
published) of Mr. [James] Montgomery's, entitled a 'Field Flower.' This
being said, Mr. Montgomery will not think any apology due to him; but I
cannot, however, help addressing him in the words of the Father of
English Poets:

    'Though it happe me to rehersin
    That ye han in your freshe songes saied,
    Forberith me, and beth not ill apaied,
    Sith that ye se I doe it in the honour
    Of Love, and eke in service of the Flour.'

1807. [Note.] See, in Chaucer and the older Poets, the honours formerly
paid to this flower.


104. *_To the same Flower_. [VIII.]

'To the Daisy,' 'To the same Flower,' and 'The Green Linnet'--all
composed at Town-End Orchard, where the bird was often seen as here
described.


105. *_To the small Celandine_. [XI.]

Grasmere, Town-End. It is remarkable that this flower coming out so
early in the spring as it does, and so bright and beautiful, and in such
profusion, should not have been noticed earlier in English verse. What
adds much to the interest that attends it, is its habit of shutting
itself up and opening out according to the degree of light and
temperature of the air. [In pencil on opposite page--Has not Chaucer
noticed it?] [Note.] Common Pilewort.


106. _The Seven Sisters_.

The story of this Poem is from the German of Frederica Brun.


107. *_The Redbreast chasing the Butterfly_. [XV.]

Observed as described in the then beautiful Orchard at Town-End.


108. *_Song for the Spinning-wheel_. [XVI.]

1806. The belief on which this is founded I have often heard expressed
by an old neighbour of Grasmere.


109. *_Hint from the Mountains_. [XVII.]

Bunches of fern may often be seen wheeling about in the wind, as here
described. The particular bunch that suggested these verses was noticed
in the Pass of Dunmail-Raise. The verses were composed in 1817, but the
application is for all times and places.


110. *_On seeing a Needle-case in the Form of a Harp_. [XVIII.] 1827.


111. *_The Contrast: the Parrot and the Wren_.

This parrot belonged to Mrs. Luff while living at Fox-Ghyll. The wren
was one that haunted for many years the Summer-house between the two
terraces at Rydal Mount. [In pencil on opposite page--Addressed to
Dora.]


112. *_The Danish Boy_. [XXII.]

Written in Germany, 1799. It was entirely a fancy; but intended as a
prelude to a ballad poem never written.


113. *_Song for the Wandering Jew_. [XXIII.] 1800.


114. *_Stray Pleasures_. [XXIV.]

Suggested on the Thames by the sight of one of those floating mills that
used to be seen there. This I noticed on the Surrey side, between
Somerset House and Blackfriars Bridge. Charles Lamb was with me at the
time; and I thought it remarkable that I should have to point out to
_him_, an idolatrous Londoner, a sight so interesting as the happy group
dancing on the platform. Mills of this kind used to he, and perhaps
still are, not uncommon on the Continent. I noticed several upon the
river Saone in the year 1799; particularly near the town of Chalons,
where my friend Jones and I halted a day when we crossed France, so far
on foot. There we embarked and floated down to Lyons.


115. *_The Pilgrim's Dream; or the Star and the Glowworm_. [XXV.]

I distinctly recollect the evening when these verses were suggested in
1818. It was on the road between Rydal and Grasmere, where glow-worms
abound. A star was shining above the ridge of Loughrigg Fell just
opposite. I remember a blockhead of a critic in some Review or other
crying out against this piece. 'What so monstrous,' said he, 'as to make
a star talk to a glowworm!' Poor fellow, we know well from this sage
observation what the 'primrose on the river's brim was to him.'

Further--In writing to Coleridge he says: 'I parted from M---- on Monday
afternoon, about six o'clock, a little on this side Rushyford. Soon
after I missed my road in the midst of the storm.... Between the
beginning of Lord Darlington's park at Raby, and two or three miles
beyond Staindrop, I composed the poem on the opposite page ['The
Pilgrim's Dream,' &c.]. I reached Barnard Castle about half-past ten.
Between eight and nine evening I reached Eusemere.' [_Memoirs_, i. pp.
181-2.]


116. *_The Poet and the caged Turtle-dove_. [XXVI.]

Rydal Mount, 1830. This dove was one of a pair that had been given to my
daughter by our excellent friend Miss Jewsbury, who went to India with
her husband Mr. Fletcher, where she died of cholera. The dove survived
its mate many years, and was killed, to our great sorrow, by a
neighbour's cat that got in at the window and dragged it partly out of
the cage. These verses were composed extempore, to the letter, in the
Terrace Summer-house before spoken of. It was the habit of the bird to
begin cooing and murmuring whenever it heard me making my verses. [In
pencil on opposite page--Dora.]


117. *_A Wren's Nest_. [XXVII.]

In Dora's Field, 1833: Rydal Mount. This nest was built as described, in
a tree that grows near the pool in Dora's field next the Rydal Mount
Garden.


118. *_Love lies bleeding_. [XXVIII.]

It has been said that the English, though their country has produced so
many great poets, is now the most unpoetical nation in Europe. It is
probably true; for they have more temptation to become so than any other
European people. Trade, commerce, and manufactures, physical science and
mechanic arts, out of which so much wealth has arisen, have made our
countrymen infinitely less sensible to movements of imagination and
fancy than were our forefathers in their simple state of society. How
touching and beautiful were in most instances the names they gave to our
indigenous flowers, or any other they were familiarly acquainted with!
Every month for many years have we been importing plants and flowers
from all quarters of the globe, many of which are spread through our
gardens, and some, perhaps, likely to be met with on the few commons
which we have left. Will their botanical names ever be displaced by
plain English appellations which will bring them home to our hearts by
connection with our joys and sorrows? It can never be, unless society
treads back her steps towards those simplicities which have been
banished by the undue influence of towns spreading and spreading in
every direction, so that city life with every generation takes more and
more the lead of rural. Among the ancients, villages were reckoned the
seats of barbarism. Refinement, for the most part false, increases the
desire to accumulate wealth; and, while theories of political economy
are boastfully pleading for the practice, inhumanity pervades all our
dealings in buying and selling. This selfishness wars against
disinterested imagination in all directions, and, evils coming round in
a circle, barbarism spreads in every quarter of our island. Oh, for the
reign of justice! and then the humblest man among us would have more
peace and dignity in and about him than the highest have now.


119. *_Rural Illusions_. [XXV.]

Rydal Mount, 1832. Observed a hundred times in the grounds at Rydal
Mount.


120. *_The Kitten and the falling Leaves_. [XXXI.]

1805. Seen at Town-End, Grasmere. The elder bush has long since
disappeared; it hung over the wall near the cottage, and the kitten
continued to leap up, catching the leaves as here described. The infant
was Dora.


121. _The Waggoner_. [XXXIII.]

DEDICATION.

                        'In Cairo's crowded streets
    The impatient Merchant, wondering, waits in vain,
    And Mecca saddens at the long delay.'

    THOMSON.

    To CHARLES LAMB, ESQ.

    MY DEAR FRIEND,

When I sent you, a few weeks ago, 'The Tale of Peter Bell,' you asked
'why "The Waggoner" was not added?'--To say the truth,--from the higher
tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the
former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without
disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, 'The Waggoner' was
read to you in manuscript, and, as you have remembered it for so long a
time, I am the more encouraged to hope that, since the localities on
which the Poem partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to
you, it may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure
the cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification
of inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have
derived from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which I am very
truly yours,

                     WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.
Rydal Mount, May 20, 1819.


122. *_The Waggoner_.

Town-End, 1805. The character and story from fact.


123. _Benjamin 'the Waggoner.'_

Several years after the event that forms the subject of the Poem, in
company with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to fall in
with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our
expressing regret that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road
either him or his waggon, he said:--'They could not do without me; and
as to the man who was put in my place, no good could come out of him; he
was a man of no _ideas_.'

The fact of my discarded hero's getting the horses out of a difficulty
with a word, as related in the poem, was told me by an eye-witness.


124. _The Dor-Hawk_.

    'The buzzing Dor-hawk round and round is wheeling' (c. i. l. 3).

When the Poem was first written the note of the bird was thus
described:--

    'The Night-hawk is singing his frog-like tune,
    Twirling his watchman's rattle about'--

but from unwillingness to startle the reader at the outset by so bold a
mode of expression, the passage was altered as it now stands.


125. _Helmcrag_ (c. i. l. 168).

A mountain of Grasmere, the broken summit of which presents two figures,
full as distinctly shaped as that of the famous Cobbler near Arroquhar
in Scotland.


126. _Merrynight_ (c. ii. l. 30).

A term well known in the North of England, and applied to rural
festivals where young persons meet in the evening for the purpose of
dancing.

    'The fiddles squeak--that call to bliss' (c. ii. l. 97).

At the close of each strathspey, or jig, a particular note from the
fiddle summons the Rustic to the agreeable duty of saluting his partner.


127. _Ghimmer-Crag _(c. iii. l. 21).

The crag of the ewe-lamb.




VI. POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION.

128. *_There was a Boy_. [I.]

Written in Germany, 1799. This is an extract from the Poem on my own
poetical education. This practice of making an instrument of their own
fingers is known to most boys, though some are more skilful at it than
others. William Raincock of Rayrigg, a fine spirited lad, took the lead
of all my schoolfellows in this art.


129. *_To the Cuckoo_. [II.] Composed in the Orchard at Town-End, 1804.


130. *_A Night-piece_. [III.]

Composed on the road between Nether Stowey and Alfoxden, extempore. I
distinctly remember the very moment when I was struck, as described, 'He
looks up at the clouds,' &c.


131. *_Yew-trees_. [V.]

Grasmere, 1803. These Yew-trees are still standing, but the spread of
that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation. I will here mention
that a little way up the hill on the road leading from Rossthwaite to
Stonethwaite lay the trunk of a yew-tree which appeared as you
approached, so vast was its diameter, like the entrance of a cave, and
not a small one. Calculating upon what I have observed of the slow
growth of this tree in rocky situations, and of its durability, I have
often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as the
Christian era. The tree lay in the line of a fence. Great masses of its
ruins were strewn about, and some had been rolled down the hill-side and
lay near the road at the bottom. As you approached the tree you were
struck with the number of shrubs and young plants, ashes, &c. which had
found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height,
forming, as it were, a part of the hedgerow. In no part of England, or
of Europe, have I ever seen a yew-tree at all approaching this in
magnitude, as it must have stood. By the bye, Hutton, the Old Guide of
Keswick, had been so imprest with the remains of this tree that he used
gravely to tell strangers that there could be no doubt of its having
been in existence before the Flood.


132. *_Nutting_. [VI.]

Written in Germany: intended as part of a poem on my own life, but
struck out as not being wanted there. Like most of my schoolfellows I
was an impassioned Nutter. For this pleasure the Vale of Esthwaite,
abounding in coppice wood, furnished a very wide range. These verses
arose out of the remembrance of feelings I had often had when a boy, and
particularly in the extensive woods that still stretch from the side of
Esthwaite Lake towards Graythwaite, the seat of the ancient family of
Sandys.


133. *_She was a Phantom of Delight_. [VIII.]

1804. Town-End. The germ of this Poem was four lines composed as a part
of the verses on the Highland Girl. Though beginning in this way, it was
written from my heart, as is sufficiently obvious.


134. *_The Nightingale_. [IX.]

Town-End, 1806. [So, but corrected in pencil 'Written at Coleorton.']


135. *_Three Years she grew, &c._ [X.]

1799. Composed in the Hartz Forest. [In pencil on opposite page--Who?]


136. _I wandered lonely as a Cloud_. [XII.] [= 'The Daffodils.']

Town-End, 1804. 'The Daffodils.' The two best lines in it are by Mary.
The daffodils grew and still grow on the margin of Ulswater, and
probably may be seen to this day as beautiful in the month of March
nodding their golden heads beside the dancing and foaming waves. [In
pencil on opposite page--Mrs. Wordsworth--but which? See the answer to
this, _infra_.]


137. _The Daffodils_. [xii.]

                        Grasmere, Nov. 4.

MT DEAR WRANGHAM,

I am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and yourself have been
gratified by these breathings of simple nature; the more so, because I
conclude from the character of the Poems which you have particularised
that the Volumes cannot but improve upon you. I see that you have
entered into the spirit of them. You mention 'The Daffodils.' You know
Butler, Montagu's friend: not Tom Butler, but the Conveyancer: when I
was in town in spring, he happened to see the Volumes lying on Montagu's
mantle-piece, and to glance his eye upon the very poem of 'The
Daffodils.' 'Aye,' says he, 'a fine morsel this for the Reviewers.' When
this was told me (for I was not present), I observed that there were
_two lines_ in that little poem which, if thoroughly felt, would
annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom, as they would find
no readers; the lines I alluded to were these:

    'They flash upon that inward eye
    Which is the bliss of solitude.'

[These two lines were composed by Mrs. Wordsworth: _Memoirs_, i. 183-4.]


138. *_The Reverie of poor Susan_. [XIII.]

Written 1801 or 1802. This arose out of my observations of the affecting
music of these birds, hanging in this way in the London streets during
the freshness and stillness of the Spring morning.


139. *_Power of Music_. [XIV.]

Taken from life, 1806.


140. *_Star-gazers_. [XV.] Observed by me in Leicester Square, as here
described, 1806.


141. *_Written in March_. [XVI.]

Extempore, 1801. This little poem was a favourite with Joanna Baillie.


142. *_Beggars_. [XVIII.]

Town-End, 1802. Met and described by me to my sister near the Quarry at
the head of Rydal Lake--a place still a chosen resort of vagrants
travelling with their families.


143. *_Gipsies_. [XX.]

Composed at Coleorton, 1807. I had observed them, as here described,
near Castle Donnington on my way to and from Derby.


144. *_Ruth_.

Written in Germany, 1799. Suggested by an account I had of a wanderer in
Somersetshire.


145. *_Resolution and Independence_. [XXII.]

Town-End, 1807. This old man I met a few hundred yards from my cottage
at Town-End, Grasmere; and the account of him is taken from his own
mouth. I was in the state of feeling described in the beginning of the
poem, while crossing over Barton Fell from Mr. Clarkson's at the foot of
Ullswater, towards Askham. The image of the hare I then observed on the
ridge of the Fell.


146. *_The Thorn_. [XXIII.]

Alfoxden, 1798. Arose out of my observing on the ridge of Quantock Hill,
on a stormy day, a thorn, which I had often past in calm and bright
weather without noticing it. I said to myself, cannot I by some
invention do as much to make this Thorn permanently an impressive object
as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment? I began the poem
accordingly, and composed it with great rapidity. Sir George Beaumont
painted a picture from it, which Wilkie thought his best. He gave it to
me; though, when he saw it several times at Rydal Mount afterwards, he
said, 'I could make a better, and would like to paint the same subject
over again.' The sky in this picture is nobly done, but it reminds one
too much of Wilson. The only fault however, of any consequence, is the
female figure, which is too old and decrepit for one likely to frequent
an eminence on such a call.


147. _Hart-Leap Well_. [XXIV.]

Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from
Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road that leads from
Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable Chase, the
memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second
Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there
described them.


148. _Ibid._

Town-End, 1800. The first eight stanzas were composed extempore one
winter evening in the cottage; when, after having tired and disgusted
myself with labouring at an awkward passage in 'The Brothers,' I started
with a sudden impulse to this, to get rid of the other, and finished it
in a day or two. My sister and I had past the place a few weeks before
in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of the Tees to
Grasmere. A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story, so far
as concerned the name of the well, and the hart, and pointed out the
stones. Both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be
missed: the tradition by this time may be extinct in the neighbourhood:
the man who related it to us was very old.

[In pencil on opposite page--See Dryden's dog and hare in _Annus
Mirabilis_.]


149. _Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle_. [XXV.]

Henry Lord Clifford, &c. &c., who is the subject of this Poem, was the
son of John Lord Clifford, who was slain at Towton Field, which John
Lord Clifford, as is known to the reader of English history, was the
person who after the battle of Wakefield slew, in the pursuit, the young
Earl of Rutland, son of the Duke of York, who had fallen in the battle,
'in part of revenge' (say the Authors of the _History of Cumberland and
Westmoreland_); 'for the Earl's father had slain his.' A deed which
worthily blemished the author (saith Speed); but who, as he adds, 'dare
promise anything temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury?
chiefly, when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the York line
standing; for so one maketh this Lord to speak.' This, no doubt, I would
observe by the bye, was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit
of the times, and yet not altogether so bad as represented; 'for the
Earl was no child, as some writers would have him, but able to bear
arms, being sixteen or seventeen years of age, as is evident from this,
(say the _Memoirs of the Countess of Pembroke_, who was laudably anxious
to wipe away, as far as could be, this stigma from the illustrious name
to which she was born,) that he was the next child to King Edward the
Fourth, which his mother had by Richard Duke of York, and that King was
then eighteen years of age: and for the small distance betwixt her
children, see Austin Vincent, in his _Book of Nobility_, p. 622, where
he writes of them all. It may further he observed, that Lord Clifford,
who was then himself only 25 years of age, had been a leading man and
commander, two or three years together in the army of Lancaster, before
this time; and, therefore, would be less likely to think that the Earl
of Rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youth.--But, independent
of this act, at best a cruel and savage one, the Family of Clifford had
done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the House of York:
so that after the battle of Towton there was no hope for them but in
flight and concealment. Henry, the subject of the poem, was deprived of
his estate and honours during the space of twenty-four years; all which
time he lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire, or in Cumberland, where the
estate of his father-in-law (Sir Lancelot Threlkeld) lay. He was
restored to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the
Seventh. It is recorded that, 'when called to Parliament, he behaved
nobly and wisely; but otherwise came seldom to London or the Court; and
rather delighted to live in the country, where he repaired several of
his castles, which had gone to decay during the late troubles.' Thus far
is chiefly collected from Nicholson and Burn; and I can add, from my own
knowledge, that there is a tradition current in the village of Threlkeld
and its neighbourhood, his principal retreat, that, in the course of his
shepherd-life, he had acquired great astronomical knowledge. I cannot
conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those
numerous and noble feudal Edifices, spoken of in the Poem, the ruins of
some of which are, at this day, so great an ornament to that interesting
country. The Cliffords had always been distinguished for an honourable
pride in these Castles; and we have seen that after the wars of York and
Lancaster they were rebuilt; in the civil wars of Charles the First they
were again laid waste, and again restored almost to their former
magnificence by the celebrated Mary Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke,
&c. &c. Not more than twenty-five years after this was done, when the
estates of Clifford had passed into the family of Tufton, three of these
castles, namely, Brough, Brougham, and Pendragon, were demolished, and
the timber and other materials sold by Thomas Earl of Thanet. We will
hope that, when this order was issued, the Earl had not consulted the
text of Isaiah, 58th chap. 12th verse, to which the inscription placed
over the gate of Pendragon Castle, by the Countess of Pembroke (I
believe his grandmother), at the time she repaired that structure,
refers the reader:--'_And they that shall be of thee shall build the old
waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;
and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of
paths to dwell in_.' The Earl of Thanet, the present possessor of the
estates, with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors, and a
proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity, has
(I am told) given orders that they shall be preserved from all
depredations.


150. *_Ibid._

See the note attached. This poem was composed at Coleorton, while I was
walking to and fro along the path that led from Sir George Beaumont's
farm-house, where we resided, to the Hall, which was building at that
time.


151. _Sir John Beaumont_.

    'Earth helped him with the cry of blood' (l. 27).

This line is from 'The Battle of Bosworth Field,' by Sir John Beaumont
(brother to the dramatist), whose poems are written with much spirit,
elegance, and harmony; and have deservedly been reprinted in Chalmers'
_Collection of English Poets_.


152. _The undying Fish of Bowscale Tarn_ (l. 122).

It is believed by the people of the country that there are two immortal
fish, inhabitants of this Tarn, which lies in the mountains not far from
Threlkeld--Blencathara, mentioned before, is the old and proper name of
the mountain vulgarly called Saddle-back.


153. _The Cliffords_.

    'Armour rusting in his Halls
    On the blood of Clifford calls' (ll. 142-3).

The martial character of the Cliffords is well known to the readers of
English history; but it may not be improper here to say, by way of
comment on these lines and what follows, that besides several others who
perished in the same manner, the four immediate Progenitors of the
Person in whose hearing this is supposed to be spoken all died on the
Field.


154. *_Tintern Abbey_. [XXVI.]

July 1798. No poem of mine was composed under circumstances more
pleasant for me to remember than this. I began it upon leaving Tintern,
after crossing the Wye, and concluded it just as I was entering Bristol
in the evening, after a ramble of four or five days with my sister. Not
a line of it was altered, and not any part of it written down till I
reached Bristol. It was published almost immediately after in the little
volume of which so much has been said in these notes, the 'Lyrical
Ballads,' as first published at Bristol by Cottle.


155. *_It is no Spirit, &c._ [XXVII.]

1803. Town-End. I remember the instant my sister Sarah Hutchinson called
me to the window of our cottage saying, 'Look, how beautiful is yon
star! It has the sky all to itself.' I composed the verses immediately.


156. _French Revolution_. [XXVIII.]

An extract from the long poem on my own poetical education. It was first
published by Coleridge in his _Friend_, which is the reason of its
having had a place in every edition of my poems since.


157. *_Yes, it was the Mountain Echo_. [XXIX.]

Town-End, 1806. The Echo came from Nabscar, when I was walking on the
opposite side of Rydal Mere. I will here mention, for my dear sister's
sake, that while she was sitting alone one day, high up on this part of
Loughrigg Fell, she was so affected by the voice of the cuckoo, heard
from the crags at some distance, that she could not suppress a wish to
have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks from which the
sound proceeded. On my return from my walk I recited those verses to
Mary, who was then confined with her son Thomas, who died in his seventh
year, as recorded on his headstone in Grasmere Churchyard.


158. _To a Skylark_. [XXX.]

Rydal Mount, 1825. [In pencil--Where there are no skylarks; but the poet
is everywhere.]


159. *_Laodamia_. [XXXI.]

Rydal Mount, 1814. Written at the same time as 'Dion,' and 'Artegal,'
and 'Elidure.' The incident of the trees growing and withering put the
subject into my thoughts, and I wrote with the hope of giving it a
loftier tone than, so far as I know, has been given it by any of the
ancients who have treated of it. It cost me more trouble than almost
anything of equal length I have ever written.


160. _Withered Trees_ (foot-note).

    'The trees' tall summits withered at the sight' (l. 73).

For the account of long-lived trees, see King's [_Natural_] _History_,
lib. xvi. cap. 44; and for the features in the character of Protesilaus,
see the _Iphigenia in Aulis_ of Euripides.


161. *_Dion_. [XXXII.]

This poem was first introduced by a stanza that I have since transferred
to the notes, for reasons there given; and I cannot comply with the
request expressed by some of my friends, that the rejected stanza should
be restored. I hope they will be content if it be hereafter immediately
attached to the poem, instead of its being degraded to a place in the
notes.

The 'reasons' (_supra_) are thus given: This poem began with the
following stanza, which has been displaced on account of its detaining
the reader too long from the subject, and as rather precluding, than
preparing for, the due effect of the allusion to the genius of Plato.


162. _Fair is the Swan, &c._ [XXXIII.] (See _supra_, 161.)


163. *_The Pass of Kirkstone_.

Rydal Mount, 1817. Thoughts and feelings of many walks in all weathers
by day and night over this Pass alone, and with beloved friends.


164. *_To_ ----. [XXXV.]

Rydal Mount, 1816. The lady was Miss Blackett, then residing with Mr.
Montague Burgoyne, at Fox-Ghyll. We were tempted to remain too long upon
the mountain, and I imprudently, with the hope of shortening the way,
led her among the crags and down a steep slope, which entangled us in
difficulties, that were met by her with much spirit and courage.


165. *_To a Young Lady_. [XXXVI.]

Composed at the same time, and on the same vein, as 'I met Louisa in the
Shade.' Indeed they were designed to make one piece. [See No. 52.]


166. *_Water-fowl_. [XXXVII.]

Observed frequently over the lakes of Rydal and Grasmere.


167. *_View from the Top of Black Comb_. [XXXVIII.]

1813. Mary and I, as mentioned in the Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont, lived
some time under its shadow.


168. *_The Haunted Tree_. [XXXIX.]

1819. This tree grew in the park of Rydal, and I have often listened to
its creaking as described.


169. *_The Triad_. [XL.]

'Rydal Mount, 1828. The girls Edith Mary Southey, my daughter Dora, and
Sarah Coleridge.' More fully on this and others contemporaneously
written, is the following letter:

           To G.H. GORDON, ESQ.
                             Rydal Mount, Dec. 15, 1828.

How strange that any one should be puzzled with the name 'Triad' _after_
reading the poem! I have turned to Dr. Johnson, and there find '_Triad,
three united_,' and not a word more, as nothing more was needed. I
should have been rather mortified if _you_ had not liked the piece, as I
think it contains some of the happiest verses I ever wrote. It had been
promised several years to two of the party before a fancy fit for the
performance struck me; it was then thrown off rapidly, and afterwards
revised with care. During the last week I wrote some stanzas on the
_Power of Sound_, which ought to find a place in my larger work if aught
should ever come of that.

In the book on the Lakes, which I have not at hand, is a passage rather
too vaguely expressed, where I content myself with saying, that after a
certain point of elevation the effect of mountains depends much more
upon their form than upon their absolute height. This point, which ought
to have been defined, is the one to which fleecy clouds (not thin watery
vapours) are accustomed to descend. I am glad you are so much interested
with this little tract; it could not have been written without long
experience.

                   I remain, most faithfully,
                           Your much obliged,
                              WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.


170. _The Wishing-gate_. [XLI.]

In the Vale of Grasmere, by the side of the old highway leading to
Ambleside, is a gate which, time out of mind, has been called the
'Wishing-gate,' from a belief that wishes formed or indulged there have
a favourable issue.


171. _The Wishing-gate destroyed_.

Having been told, upon what I thought good authority, that this gate had
been destroyed, and the opening, where it hung, walled up, I gave vent
immediately to my feelings in these stanzas. But going to the place some
time after, I found, with much delight, my old favourite unmolested.
[*Rydal Mount, 1828.]


172. *_The Primrose of the Rock_. [XLIII.]

Rydal Mount, 1821. It stands on the right hand, a little way leading up
the vale from Grasmere to Rydal. We have been in the habit of calling it
the glow-worm rock, from the number of glow-worms we have often seen
hanging on it as described. The tuft of primrose has, I fear, been
washed away by heavy rains.


173. *_Presentiments_. [XLIV.]

Rydal Mount, 1830.


174. *_Vernal Ode_. [XLV.]

Rydal Mount, 1817. Composed to place in view the immortality of
succession where immortality is denied, so far as we know, to the
individual creature.


175. *_Devotional Incitements_. [XLVI.]

Rydal Mount, 1832.


176. *_The Cuckoo-Clock_. [XLVII.]

Of this clock I have nothing further to say than what the poem
expresses, except that it must be here recorded that it was a present
from the dear friend for whose sake these notes were chiefly undertaken,
and who has written them from my dictation.


177. *_To the Clouds_. [XLVIII.]

These verses were suggested while I was walking on the foot-road between
Rydal Mount and Grasmere. The clouds were driving over the top of
Nab-Scar across the vale; they set my thoughts agoing, and the rest
followed almost immediately.


178. *_Suggested by a Picture of the Bird of Paradise_. [XLIX.]

This subject has been treated of before (see a former note). I will here
only, by way of comment, direct attention to the fact, that pictures of
animals and other productions of Nature, as seen in conservatories,
menageries and museums, &c., would do little for the national mind, nay,
they would be rather injurious to it, if the imagination were excluded
by the presence of the object, more or less out of the state of Nature.
If it were not that we learn to talk and think of the lion and the
eagle, the palm-tree, and even the cedar, from the impassioned
introduction of them so frequently in Holy Scripture, and by great
poets, and divines who write as poets, the spiritual part of our nature,
and therefore the higher part of it, would derive no benefit from such
intercourse with such subjects.


179. *_A Jewish Family_. [L.]

Coleridge and my daughter and I in 1828 passed a fortnight upon the
banks of the Rhine, principally under the hospitable roof of Mr. Aders
at Gotesburg, but two days of the time were spent at St. Goa or in
rambles among the neighbouring vallies. It was at St. Goa that I saw the
Jewish family here described. Though exceedingly poor, and in rags, they
were not less beautiful than I have endeavoured to make them appear. We
had taken a little dinner with us in a basket, and invited them to
partake of it, which the mother refused to do both for herself and her
children, saying it was with them a fast-day; adding diffidently, that
whether such observances were right or wrong, _she_ felt it her duty to
keep them strictly. The Jews, who are numerous in this part of the
Rhine, greatly surpass the German peasantry in the beauty of their
features and in the intelligence of their countenances. But the lower
classes of the German peasantry have, here at least, the air of people
grievously opprest. Nursing mothers at the age of seven or eight and
twenty often look haggard and far more decayed and withered than women
of Cumberland and Westmoreland twice their age. This comes from being
under-fed and over-worked in their vineyards in a hot and glaring sun.
[In pencil on opposite page--The three went from my house in
Bryanston-street, London--E.Q.]


180. *_On the Power of Sound_. [LI.]

Rydal Mount, 1828. I have often regretted that my tour in Ireland,
chiefly performed in the short days of October in a carriage and four (I
was with Mr. Marshall), supplied my memory with so few images that were
new and with so little motive to write. The lines, however, in this
poem, 'Thou too he heard, lone eagle!' &c., were suggested near the
Giant's Causeway, or rather at the promontory of Fairhead, where a pair
of eagles wheeled above our heads, and darted off as if to hide
themselves in a blaze of sky made by the setting sun.


181. _Peter Bell: a Tale_.

                DEDICATION.
        'What's in a _Name_?'
    'Brutus will start a Spirit as soon as Caesar!'

          To ROBERT SOUTHEY, ESQ., P.L., ETC., ETC.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

The Tale of 'Peter Bell,' which I now introduce to your notice, and to
that of the Public, has, in its Manuscript state, nearly survived its
_minority_:--for it first saw the light in the summer of 1798. During
this long interval, pains have been taken at different times to make the
production less unworthy of a favourable reception; or, rather, to fit
it for filling _permanently_ a station, however humble, in the
Literature of our Country. This has, indeed, been the aim of all my
endeavours in Poetry, which, you know, have been sufficiently laborious
to prove that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached; and that the
attainment of excellence in it may laudably be made the principal object
of intellectual pursuit by any man who, with reasonable consideration of
circumstances, has faith in his own impulses.

The Poem of 'Peter Bell,' as the Prologue will show, was composed under
a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its exercise
the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though such agency be
excluded, the faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred
results of pleasure, by incidents, within the compass of poetic
probability, in the humblest departments of daily life. Since that
Prologue was written, _you_ have exhibited most splendid effects of
judicious daring, in the opposite and usual course. Let this
acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the supernatural; and I
am persuaded it will be admitted that to you, as a Master in that
province of the art, the following Tale, whether from contrast or
congruity, is not an inappropriate offering. Accept it, then, as a
public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name
yours has been often coupled (to use your own words) for evil and for
good; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life and health may
be granted you to complete the many important works in which you are
engaged, and with high respect,

                 Most faithfully yours,
                      WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.
Rydal Mount, April 7, 1819.


182. _Peter Bell: the Poem_.

Alfoxden, 1798. Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a newspaper, of
an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture.
Upon examination a dead body was found in the water, and proved to be
the body of its master. The countenance, gait, and figure of Peter were
taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from Builth, on the river
Wye, downwards, nearly as far as the town of Hay. He told me strange
stories. It has always been a pleasure to me, through life, to catch at
every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted
with this class of people. The number of Peter's wives was taken from
the trespasses, in this way, of a lawless creature who lived in the
county of Durham, and used to be attended by many women, sometimes not
less than half a dozen, as disorderly as himself; and a story went in
the country, that he had been heard to say while they were quarrelling,
'Why can't you be quiet, there's none so many of you.' Benoni, or the
child of sorrow, I knew when I was a school-boy. His mother had been
deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, she herself being a
gentlewoman by birth. The circumstances of her story were told me by my
dear old dame, Ann Tyson, who was her confidante. The lady died
broken-hearted. In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great delight in
noticing the habits, tricks, and physiognomy of asses; and I have no
doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the
creature that is so often dreadfully abused. The crescent moon, which
makes such a figure in the prologue, assumed this character one evening
while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House. I intended
this poem for the volume before spoken of, but it was not published for
more than twenty years afterwards. The worship of the Methodists, or
Ranters, is often heard during the stillness of the summer evening, in
the country, with affecting accompaniments of rural beauty. In both the
psalmody and voice of the preacher there is, not unfrequently, much
solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the rudest characters under
favourable circumstances.

_Potter_ (foot-note).

    'A Potter, Sir, he was by trade' (Pt. I. l. 11).

In the dialect of the North, a hawker of earthenware is thus designated.




VII. MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS.

PART I.


183. *_Commencement of writing of Sonnets_.

In the cottage of Town-End, one afternoon in 1801, my sister read to me
the sonnets of Milton. I had long been well acquainted with them, but I
was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity
and majestic harmony that runs through most of them--in character so
totally different from the Italian, and still more so from Shakespeare's
fine sonnets. I took fire, if I may be allowed to say so, and produced
three sonnets the same afternoon--the first I ever wrote, except an
irregular one at school. Of these three, the only one I distinctly
remember is 'I grieved for Buonaparte,' &c. One was never written down;
the third, which was I believe preserved, I cannot particularise.


184. _Admonition_.

    'Well mays't thou halt,' &c. [II.]

Intended more particularly for the perusal of those who have happened to
be enamoured of some beautiful place of retreat in the Country of the
Lakes.


185. *_Sonnet_ IV.

    'Beaumont! it was thy wish,' &c.

This was presented to me by Sir George Beaumont, with a view to the
erection of a house upon it, for the sake of being near to Coleridge,
then living, and likely to remain, at Greta Hall, near Keswick. The
severe necessities that prevented this arose from his domestic
situation. This little property, with a considerable addition that still
leaves it very small, lies beautifully upon the banks of a rill that
gurgles down the side of Skiddaw; and the orchard and other parts of the
grounds command a magnificent prospect of Derwent Water, the Mountains
of Borrowdale and Newlands. Not many years ago I gave the place to my
daughter. [In pencil on opposite page in Mrs. Quillinan's
handwriting--Many years ago, sir, for it was given when she was a frail
feeble monthling.]


186. *_Sonnet_ VI.

    'There is a little unpretending rill.'

This rill trickles down the hill-side into Windermere near Lowood. My
sister and I, on our first visit together to this part of the country,
walked from Kendal, and we rested to refresh ourselves by the side of
the Lake where the streamlet falls into it. This sonnet was written some
years after in recollection of that happy ramble, that most happy day
and hour.


187. *_Sonnet_ VIII.

    'The fairest, brightest hues,' &c.

Suggested at Hackett, which is the craggy ridge that rises between the
two Langdales, and looks towards Windermere. The cottage of Hackett was
often visited by us; and at the time when this sonnet was written, and
long after, was occupied by the husband and wife described in 'The
Excursion,' where it is mentioned that she was in the habit of walking
in the front of the dwelling with a light to guide her husband home at
night. The same cottage is alluded to in the Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont
as that from which the female peasant hailed us on our morning journey.
The musician mentioned in the sonnet was the Rev. P. Tilbrook of
Peterhouse, who remodelled the Ivy Cottage at Rydal after he had
purchased it.

188. '_The Genius_.'

    'Such strains of rapture as the Genius played.'

See the 'Vision of Mirza' in the _Spectator_.

189. *_Sonnet_ IX.

Upon the sight of a beautiful picture.

This was written when we dwelt in the Parsonage at Grasmere. The
principal features of the picture are Bredon Hill and Cloud Hill, near
Coleorton. I shall never forget the happy feeling with which my heart
was filled when I was impelled to compose this sonnet. We resided only
two years in this house; and during the last half of this time, which
was after this poem had been written, we lost our two children, Thomas
and Catherine. Our sorrow upon these events often brought it to my mind,
and cast me upon the support to which the last line of it gives
expression:

    'The appropriate calm of blest eternity.'

It is scarcely necessary to add that we still possess the picture.


190. *_Sonnet_ XI.

Aerial Rock.

A projecting point of Loughrigg, nearly in front of Rydal Mount. Thence
looking at it, you are struck with the boldness of its aspect; but
walking under it, you admire the beauty of its details. It is vulgarly
called Holme-scar, probably from the insulated pasture by the waterside
below it.


191. *_Sonnet_ XV.

The Wild Duck's Nest.

I observed this beautiful nest on the largest island of Rydal Water.


192. *_Sonnet_ XIX.

    'Grief thou hast lost,' &c.

I could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes brought about
among the cottages of Westmoreland by the silence of the spinning-wheel.
During long winter's nights and wet days, the wheel upon which wool was
spun gave employment to a great part of a family. The old man, however
infirm, was able to card the wool, as he sate in the corner by the
fireside; and often, when a boy, have I admired the cylinders of carded
wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side. Two wheels were
often at work on the same floor, and others of the family, chiefly the
little children, were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit
it for the hand of the carder. So that all, except the infants, were
contributing to mutual support: Such was the employment that prevailed
in the pastoral vales. Where wool was not at hand, in the small rural
towns, the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use, if
knitting was not preferred; which latter occupation had the advantage
(in some cases disadvantage) that not being of necessity stationary, it
allowed of gossiping about from house to house, which good housewives
reckoned an idle thing.


193. *_Sonnet_ XXII.

Decay of Piety.

Attendance at church on prayer-days, Wednesdays and Fridays and
holidays, received a shock at the Revolution. It is now, however,
happily reviving. The ancient people described in this sonnet were among
the last of that pious class. May we hope that the practice now in some
degree renewed will continue to spread.


194. *_Sonnets_ XXIV. XXV. XXVI.

Translations from Michael Angelo, done at the request of Mr. Duppa,
whose acquaintance I made through Mr. Southey. Mr. Duppa was engaged in
writing the life of Michael Angelo, and applied to Mr. Southey and
myself to furnish some specimens of his poetic genius.


195. *_Sonnet_ XXVII.

    'Surprised by joy,' &c.

This was in fact suggested by my daughter Catherine long after her
death.


196. *_Sonnets_ XXVIII. XXIX.

    'Methought I saw,' &c. 'Even so for me,' &c.

The latter part of the first of these was a great favourite with my
sister, Sara Hutchinson. When I saw her lying in death, I could not
resist the impulse to compose the sonnet that follows.


197. *_Sonnet_ XXX.

    'It is a beauteous evening,' &c.

This was composed on the beach near Calais, in the autumn of 1802.


198. *_Sonnet_ XXXVI.

    'Calvert! it must not be,' &c.

This young man, Raisley Calvert, to whom I was so much indebted, died at
Penrith, 179-.


       *       *       *       *       *


PART II.


199. *_Sonnet_ IV.

    'From the dark chambers,' &c.

Composed in Edinburgh, during my Scotch tour with Mary and Sara, in the
year 1814. Poor Gillies never rose above the course of extravagance in
which he was at that time living, and which soon reduced him to poverty
and all its degrading shifts, mendicity being far from the worst. I
grieve whenever I think of him; for he was far from being without
genius, and had a generous heart--which is not always to be found in men
given up to profusion. He was nephew of Lord Gillies, the Scotch judge,
and also of the historian of Greece. He was cousin of Miss Margaret
Gillies, who painted so many portraits with success in our house.


200. *_Sonnet_ V.

'Fool, prime of life,' &c.

Suggested by observation of the way in which a young friend, whom I do
not choose to name, misspent his time and misapplied his talents. He
took afterwards a better course, and became an useful member of society,
respected, I believe, wherever he has been known.


201. *_Sonnet_ VI.

'I watch, and long have watched,' &c.

Suggested in front of Rydal Mount, the rocky parapet being the summit of
Loughrigg Fell opposite. Not once only but a hundred times have the
feelings of this sonnet been awakened by the same objects from the same
place.


202. _Sonnet_ VII.

'The ungenial Hollow.'

See the 'Phaedon' of Plato, by which this sonnet was suggested.


203. _Sonnet_ VIII.

'For the whole weight,' &c.

Composed, almost extempore, in a short walk on the western side of Rydal
Lake.


204. *_Sonnet_ X.

'Mark the concentred hazels,' &c.

Suggested in the wild hazel-wood at foot of Helm-Crag, where the stone
still lies, with others of like form and character, though much of the
wood that veiled it from the glare of day has been felled. This
beautiful ground was lately purchased by our friend, Mrs. Fletcher, the
ancient owners, most respected persons, being obliged to part with it in
consequence of the imprudence, if not misconduct, of a son. It is
gratifying to mention that instead of murmuring and repining at this
change of fortune they offered their services to Mrs. Fletcher, the
husband as an out-door labourer and the wife as a domestic servant. I
have witnessed the pride and pleasure with which the man worked at
improvements of the ground round the house. Indeed he expressed them to
me himself, and the countenance and manner of his wife always denoted
feelings of the same character. I believe a similar disposition to
contentment under change of fortune is common among the class to which
these good people belong. Yet, in proof that to part with their
patrimony is most painful to them, I may refer to those stanzas entitled
'Repentance,' no inconsiderable part of which was taken _verbatim_ from
the language of the speaker himself. [In pencil--Herself, M.N.]


205. *_Sonnet_ XI.

'Dark and more dark,' &c.

October 3d or 4th, 1802. Composed after a journey over the Hambleton
Hills, on a day memorable to me--the day of my marriage. The horizon
commanded by those hills is most magnificent.

The next day, while we were travelling in a post-chaise up Wensley Dale,
we were stopt by one of the horses proving restiff, and were obliged to
wait two hours in a severe storm before the post-boy could fetch from
the Inn another to supply its place. The spot was in front of Bolton
Hall, where Mary Queen of Scots was kept prisoner soon after her
unfortunate landing at Workington. The place then belonged to the
Scroopes, and memorials of her are yet preserved there. To beguile the
time I composed a sonnet. The subject was our own confinement contrasted
with hers; but it was not thought worthy of being preserved.


206. *_Sonnet_ XIII.

'While not a leaf,' &c.

September 1815. 'For me, who under kindlier laws,' &c. (l. 9). This
conclusion has more than once, to my great regret, excited painfully sad
feelings in the hearts of young persons fond of poetry and poetic
composition by contrast of their feeble and declining health with that
state of robust constitution which prompted me to rejoice in a season of
frost and snow as more favourable to the Muses than summer itself.


207. *_Sonnet_ XIV.

'How clear, how keen,' &c.

November 1st. Suggested on the banks of the Brathay by the sight of
Langdale Pikes. It is delightful to remember those moments of
far-distant days, which probably would have been forgotten if the
impression had not been transferred to verse. The same observation
applies to the rest.


208. *_Sonnet_ XV.

One who was suffering,' &c.

Composed during a storm in Rydal Wood by the side of a torrent.


209. *_Sonnet_ XVIII.

'Lady, the songs of Spring,' &c.

1807. To Lady Beaumont. The winter garden of Coleorton, fashioned out of
an old quarry under the superintendence and direction of Mrs. Wordsworth
and my sister Dorothy, during the Winter and Spring of the year we
resided there.


210. *_Sonnet_ XIX.

'There is a pleasure,' &c.

Written on a journey from Brinsop Court, Herefordshire.


211. *_Sonnet_ XXIX.

'Though narrow,' &c.

1807. Coleorton. This old man's name was Mitchell. He was, in all his
ways and conversation, a great curiosity, both individually and as a
representative of past times. His chief employment was keeping watch at
night by pacing round the house at that time building, to keep off
depredators. He has often told me gravely of having seen the 'Seven
Whistlers and the Hounds' as here described. Among the groves of
Coleorton, where I became familiar with the habits and notions of old
Mitchell, there was also a labourer of whom I regret I had no personal
knowledge; for, more than forty years after, when he was become an old
man, I learnt that while I was composing verses, which I usually did
aloud, he took much pleasure, unknown to me, in following my steps, that
he might catch the words I uttered, and, what is not a little
remarkable, several lines caught in this way kept their place in his
memory. My volumes have lately been given to him, by my informant, and
surely he must have been gratified to meet in print his old
acquaintance.


212. *_Sonnet_ XXX. 'Four fiery steeds,' &c.

Suggested on the road between Preston and Lancaster, where it first
gives a view of the Lake country, and composed on the same day, on the
roof of the coach.


213. *_Sonnet_ XXXI. 'Brook! whose society,' &c.

Also composed on the roof of a coach, on my way to France, September
1802.


214. *_Sonnets_ XXXIII.-V. 'Waters.'

Waters (as Mr. Westall informs us in the letter-press prefixed to his
admirable views [of the Caves, &c. of Yorkshire]) are invariably found
to flow through these caverns.

       *       *       *       *       *




PART III


215. *_Sonnet_ IV. 'Fame tells of Groves,' &c.

Wallachia is the country alluded to.


216. *_Sonnet_ VII. 'Where lively ground,' &c.

This parsonage was the residence of my friend Jones, and is particularly
described in another note.


217. *_Sonnet_ IX. 'A stream to mingle,' &c.

In this Vale of Meditation ['Glen Mywr'] my friend Jones resided, having
been allowed by his Diocesan to fix himself there without resigning his
living in Oxfordshire. He was with my wife and daughter and me when we
visited these celebrated ladies, who had retired, as one may say, into
notice in this vale. Their cottage lay directly in the road between
London and Dublin, and they were, of course, visited by their Irish
friends as well as innumerable strangers. They took much delight in
passing jokes on our friend Jones's plumpness, ruddy cheeks, and smiling
countenance, as little suited to a hermit living in the Vale of
Meditation. We all thought there was ample room for retort on his part,
so curious was the appearance of these ladies, so elaborately
sentimental about themselves and their _caro Albergo_, as they named it
in an inscription on a tree that stood opposite, the endearing epithet
being preceded by the word _Ecco_! calling upon the saunterer to look
about him. So oddly was one of these ladies attired that we took her, at
a little distance, for a Roman Catholic priest, with a crucifix and
relics hung at his neck. They were without caps; their hair bushy and
white as snow, which contributed to the mistake.


218. _Sonnet_ XI. In the Woods of Rydal.

This Sonnet, as Poetry, explains itself, yet the scene of the incident
having been a wild wood, it may be doubted, as a point of natural
history, whether the bird was aware that his attentions were bestowed
upon a human, or even a living creature. But a Redbreast will perch upon
the foot of a gardener at work, and alight on the handle of the spade
when his hand is half upon it. This I have seen. And under my own roof I
have witnessed affecting instances of the creature's friendly visits to
the chambers of sick persons, as described in the verses to the
Redbreast [No. 83]. One of these welcome intruders used frequently to
roost upon a nail in the wall, from which a picture had hung, and was
ready, as morning came, to pipe his song in the hearing of the invalid,
who had been long confined to her room. These attachments to a
particular person, when marked and continued, used to be reckoned
ominous; but the superstition is passing away.


219. *_Sonnet_ XIII. 'While Anna's peers,' &c.

This is taken from the account given by Miss Jewsbury of the pleasure
she derived, when long confined to her bed by sickness, from the
inanimate object on which this Sonnet turns.

220. *_Sonnet_ XV. 'Wait, prithee wait,' &c.

The fate of this poor dove, as described, was told to me at Brinsop
Court by the young lady to whom I have given the name of Lesbia.


221. *_Sonnet_ XVI. 'Unquiet childhood,' &c.

The infant was Mary Monkhouse, the only daughter of our friend and
cousin Thomas Monkhouse.


222. *_Sonnet_ XVII. 'Such age how beautiful!' &c.

Lady Fitzgerald as described to me by Lady Beaumont.


223. *_Sonnet_ XVIIII. 'Rotha! my spiritual child,' &c.

Rotha, the daughter of my son-in-law Mr. Quillinan.


224. _The Rotha_. 'The peaceful mountain stream,' &c.

The river Rotha, that flows into Windermere from the Lakes of Grasmere
and Rydal.


225. *_Sonnet_ XIX. 'Miserrimus.'

Many conjectures have been formed as to the person who lies under this
stone. Nothing appears to be known for a certainty. ?The Rev. Mr.
Morris, a Nonconformist, a sufferer for conscience' sake; a worthy man,
who having been deprived of his benefice after the accession of William
III, lived to an old age in extreme destitution, on the alms of
charitable Jacobites.


226. *_Sonnet_ XX. 'While poring,' &c.

My attention to these antiquities was directed by Mr. Walker, son to the
itinerant Eidouranian philosopher. The beautiful pavement was discovered
within a few yards of the front door of his parsonage, and appeared
(from the site in full view of several hills upon which there had
formerly been Roman encampments) as if it might have been the villa of
the commander of the forces; at least such was Mrs. W.'s conjecture.

227. *_Sonnet_ XXI.

    'Chatsworth! thy stately mansion,' &c.

I have reason to remember the day that gave rise to this Sonnet, the 6th
of November 1830. Having undertaken--a great feat for me--to ride my
daughter's pony from Westmoreland to Cambridge, that she might have the
use of it while on a visit to her uncle at Trinity Lodge, on my way from
Bakewell to Matlock I turned aside to Chatsworth, and had scarcely
gratified my curiosity by the sight of that celebrated place before
there came on a severe storm of wind and rain, which continued till I
reached Derby, both man and pony in a pitiable plight. For myself I went
to bed at noon-day. In the course of that journey I had to encounter a
storm worse if possible, in which the pony could (or would) only make
his way slantwise. I mention this merely to add, that notwithstanding
this battering, I composed on pony-back the lines to the memory of Sir
George Beaumont, suggested during my recent visit to Coleorton.

228. *_Sonnet_ XXII.

    'Tis said that to the brow,' &c.

This pleasing tradition was told me by the coachman at whose side I sate
while he drove down the dale, he pointing to the trees on the hill as he
related the story.

229. *_Sonnet_ XXIII.

    'Untouched through all severity of cold.'

This was also communicated to me by a coachman in the same way. In the
course of my many coach rambles and journeys, which, during the daytime
always, and often in the night, were taken on the outside of the coach,
I had good and frequent opportunities of learning the character of this
class of men. One remark I made, that is worth recording, that whenever
I had occasion especially to notice their well-ordered, respectful, and
kind behaviour to women, of whatever age, I found them, I may say almost
always, to be married men.


230. *_Sonnet_ XXIV.

'Go, faithful Tishart,' &c.

The six last lines of this sonnet are not written for poetical effect,
but as a matter of fact, which in more than one instance could not
escape my notice in the servants of the house.


231. *_Sonnet_ XXV.

'Why art thou silent?'

In the month of January [blank], when Dora and I were walking from
Town-End, Grasmere, across the vale, snow being on the ground, she
espied in the thick though leafless hedge a bird's-nest half filled with
snow. Out of this comfortless appearance arose this Sonnet, which was,
in fact, written without the least reference to any individual object,
but merely to prove to myself that I could, if I thought fit, write in a
strain that poets have been fond of. On the 14th of February in the same
year, my daughter, in a sportive mood, sent it as a Valentine under a
fictitious name to her cousin C. W.


232. *_Sonnet_ XXVI.

'Haydon! let worthier judges,' &c.

This Sonnet, though said to be written on seeing the portrait of
Napoleon, was in fact composed some time after, extempore, in Rydal
Mount. [In pencil--But it was said in prose in Haydon's studio, for I
was present: relate the facts and why it was versified.]


233. *_Sonnet_ XXVII.

'A poet!--He hath put,' &c.

I was impelled to write this Sonnet by the disgusting frequency with
which the word _artistical_, imported with other impertinencies from the
Germans, is employed by writers of the present day. For 'artistical' let
them substitute 'artificial,' and the poetry written on this system,
both at home and abroad, will be, for the most part, much better
characterised.


234. *_Sonnet_ XXVIII.

'The most alluring clouds,' &c.

Hundreds of times have I seen hanging about and above the Vale of Rydal,
clouds that might have given birth to this Sonnet; which was thrown
off, on the impulse of the moment, one evening when I was returning home
from the favourite walk of ours along the Rotha, under Loughrigg.


235. *_Sonnet_ XXIX.

'By Art's bold privilege,' &c.

This was composed while I was ascending Helvelyn in company with my
daughter and her husband. She was on horseback, and rode to the very top
of the hill without once dismounting: a feat which it was scarcely
possible to perform except during a season of dry weather, and a guide
with whom we fell in on the mountain told us he believed it had never
been accomplished before by any one.


236. *_Sonnet_ XXXII.

'All praise the likeness,' &c.

The picture which gave occasion to this and the following Sonnet was
from the pencil of Miss M. Gillies, who resided for several weeks under
our roof at Rydal Mount.


237. *_Sonnet_ XXXVI.

'Oh, what a wreck,' &c.

The sad condition of poor Mrs. Southey put me upon writing this. It has
afforded comfort to many persons whose friends have been similarly
affected.


238. *_Sonnet_ XXXVII.

'Intent on gathering wool,' &c.

Suggested by a conversation with Miss F., who along with her sister had
during their childhood found much delight in such gatherings for the
purpose here alluded to.


239. _Sonnet_ XLII.

Wansfel.

The Hill that rises to the south-east above Ambleside.


240. _Sonnet_ XLIII.

----'a little rural town.'

Ambleside.




VIII. MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN SCOTLAND, 1803.


241. *_Setting out_.

Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and myself started together from Town-End, to
make a tour in Scotland, August [14th]. Poor Coleridge was at that time
in bad spirits, and somewhat too much in love with his own dejection,
and he departed from us, as is recorded in my sister's Journal, soon
after we left Loch Lomond. The verses that stand foremost among these
memorials were not actually written for the occasion, but transplanted
from my Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont.


242. *_To the Sons of Burns after visiting the Grave of their Father_.
[iv.]

See, in connection with these verses, two other poems upon Burns, one
composed actually at the time, and the other, though then felt, not put
into words till several years afterwards [viz. 'At the Grave of Burns,
1803, Seven Years after his Death (II.);' and 'Thoughts suggested the
Day following, on the Banks of Nith, near the Poet's Residence.' (III.)
Another Note in I.F. MSS. is nearly the same as this: viz. To be printed
among the Poems relating to my first Tour in Scotland: for illustrations
see my Sister's Journal. It may be proper to add that the second of
these pieces, though _felt_ at the time, was not composed till many
years after].


243. *_Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of Kirtle_. [v.]

It may be worth while to observe, that as there are Scotch poems on this
subject, in the simple ballad strain, I thought it would be both
presumptuous and superfluous to attempt treating it in the same way; and
accordingly, I chose a construction of stanza quite new in our language;
in fact, the same as that of Bürgher's 'Leonora,' except that the first
and third lines do not in my stanzas rhyme. At the outset, I threw out a
classical image, to prepare the reader for the style in which I meant to
treat the story, and so to preclude all comparison. [Note.--The Kirtle
is a river in the southern part of Scotland, on the banks of which the
events here related took place.]


244. *_To a Highland Girl_. [VI.]

This delightful creature, and her demeanour, are particularly described
in my sister's Journal. The sort of prophecy with which the verses
conclude has, through God's goodness, been realised; and now,
approaching the close of my seventy-third year, I have a most vivid
remembrance of her, and the beautiful objects with which she was
surrounded. She is alluded to in the poem of 'The Three Cottage Girls,'
among my continental memorials. In illustration of this class of poems,
I have scarcely anything to say beyond what is anticipated in my
sister's faithful and admirable Journal.


245. _Stepping Westward_. [VII.]

While my fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of Loch
Ketterine [Katrine] one fine evening after sunset, in our road to a Hut
where, in the course of our Tour, we had been hospitably entertained
some weeks before, we met, in one of the loneliest parts of that
solitary region, two well-dressed women, one of whom said to us, by way
of greeting, 'What, you are stepping westward?'


246. *_Address to Kilchurn Castle_. [X.]

The first three lines were thrown off at the moment I first caught sight
of the ruin from a small eminence by the wayside; the rest was added
many years after. [Note.--The tradition is that the Castle was built by
a Lady during the absence of her Lord in Palestine.]


247. *_Rob Roys Grave_. [XI.]

I have since been told that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of
Bob Roy; if so, I may plead in excuse that I wrote on apparently good
authority, namely, that of a well-educated lady, who lived at the head
of the Lake, within a mile, or less, of the point indicated as
containing the remains of one so famous in that neighbourhood. [Note
prefixed.--The history of Rob Roy is sufficiently known; his grave is
near the head of Loch Ketterine, in one of those small pinfold-like
burial-grounds, of neglected and desolate appearance, which the
traveller meets with in the Highlands of Scotland.]


248. *_Sonnet composed at ---- Castle_, 1803. [XII.]


The castle here mentioned was Nidpath, near Peebles. The person alluded
to was the then Duke of Queensberry. The fact was told me by Walter
Scott.

249. _Yarrow Unvisited_. [XIII.]

See the various Poems the scene of which is laid upon the banks of the
Yarrow; in particular the exquisite Ballad of Hamilton beginning

    'Busk ye, busk ye, my bonnie, bonnie Bride,
    Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome Marrow.'


250. _The Matron of Jedborough [Jedburgh] and her Husband_. [XV.]

At Jedborough, my companion and I went into private lodgings for a few
days; and the following Verses were called forth by the character and
domestic situation of our Hostess.


251. *_Sonnet, 'Fly, some kind Harbinger.'_ [XVI.]

This was actually composed the last day of our tour, between Dalston and
Grasmere.


252. *_The Blind Highland Boy_. [XVII.]

The story was told me by George Mackreth, for many years parish-clerk of
Grasmere. He had been an eye-witness of the occurrence. The vessel in
reality was a washing-tub, which the little fellow had met with on the
shore of the loch. [Appended Note.--It is recorded in Dampier's
_Voyages_ that a boy, son of the captain of a man-of-war, seated himself
in a turtle-shell and floated in it from the shore to his father's ship,
which lay at anchor at the distance of half a mile. In deference to the
opinion of a friend, I have substituted such a shell for the less
elegant vessel in which my blind Voyager did actually intrust himself to
the dangerous current of Loch Leven, as was related to me by an
eye-witness.]




IX. MEMORIALS OF A SECOND TOUR IN SCOTLAND, 1814.


253. *_Suggested by a beautiful Ruin upon one of the islands of Loch
Lomond: a place chosen for the retreat of a solitary individual, from
whom this Habitation acquired the name of the Brownie's Cell_,[I.]

In this tour my wife and her sister Sara were my companions. The account
of the Brownie's Cell, and the Brownies, was given me by a man we met
with on the banks of Loch Lomond, a little above Tarbert, and in front
of a huge mass of rock by the side of which, we were told, preachings
were often held in the open air. The place is quite a solitude, and the
surrounding scenery very striking. How much is it to be regretted that,
instead of writing such poems as the 'Holy Fair,' and others in which
the religious observances of his country are treated with so much
levity, and too often with indecency, Burns had not employed his genius
in describing religion under the serious and affecting aspects it must
so frequently take.


254. *_Composed at Corra Linn, in sight of Wallace Tower_.[II.]

I had seen this celebrated waterfall twice before. But the feelings to
which it had given birth were not expressed till they recurred in
presence of the object on this occasion.


255. *_Effusion in the Pleasure-ground on the Banks of the Braw, near
Dunkeld_.[III.]

I am not aware that this condemnatory effusion was ever seen by the
owner of the place. He might be disposed to pay little attention to it;
but, were it to prove otherwise, I should be glad, for the whole
exhibition is distressingly puerile.


256. *_Yarrow Visited_.[IV.]

As mentioned in my verses on the death of the Ettrick Shepherd, my first
visit to Yarrow was in his company. We had lodged the night before at
Traquhair, where Hogg had joined us, and also Dr. Anderson, the editor
of the British Poets, who was on a visit at the Manse. Dr. A. walked
with us till we came in view of the vale of Yarrow, and being advanced
in life he then turned back. The old man was passionately fond of
poetry, though with not much of a discriminating judgment, as the
volumes he edited sufficiently shew. But I was much pleased to meet with
him and to acknowledge my obligation to his Collection, which had been
my brother John's companion in more than one voyage to India, and which
he gave me before his departure from Grasmere never to return. Through
these volumes I became first familiar with Chaucer; and so little money
had I then to spare for books, that, in all probability, but for this
same work, I should have known little of Drayton, Daniel, and other
distinguished poets of the Elizabethan age and their immediate
successors, till a much later period of my life. I am glad to record
this, not for any importance of its own, but as a tribute of gratitude
to this simple-hearted old man, whom I never again had the pleasure of
meeting. I seldom read or think of this poem without regretting that my
dear sister was not of the party, as she would have had so much delight
in recalling the time when, travelling together in Scotland, we declined
going in search of this celebrated stream, not altogether, I will
frankly confess, for the reasons assigned in the poem on the occasion.

       *       *       *       *       *




X. POEMS DEDICATED TO NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND LIBERTY.

[HEADED IN I.F. NOTES 'SONNETS DEDICATED TO LIBERTY.']


257. _Robert Jones_.

'Jones! as from Calais,' &c. [Sonnet III.]

(See No. 9, Dedication to Descriptive Sketches.)

This excellent Person, one of my earliest and dearest friends, died in
the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year, at the
same college, and companions in many a delightful ramble through his own
romantic country of North Wales. Much of the latter part of his life he
passed in comparative solitude; which I know was often cheered by
remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the beautiful regions
which, at home and abroad, we had visited together. Our long friendship
was never subject to a moment's interruption,--and, while revising
these volumes for the last time, I have been so often reminded of my
loss, with a not unpleasing sadness, that I trust the Reader will excuse
this passing mention of a Man who well deserves from me something more
than so brief a notice. Let me only add, that during the middle part of
his life he resided many years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a
Parsonage in Oxfordshire, which is the subject of the seventh of the
'Miscellaneous Sonnets,' Part III.


258. _I grieved for Buonaparte. [Sonnet_ IV.]

[Note No. 183 is repeated here.]


259. _The King of Sweden and Toussaint L'Ouverture_.

[Sonnets VII. and VIII.]

In this and a succeeding Sonnet on the same subject, let me be
understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King of
Sweden occupied, and of the principles AVOWED IN HIS MANIFESTOS; as
laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral
truths. This remark might, perhaps, as well have been suppressed; for to
those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems, it will be
superfluous; and will, I fear, be thrown away upon that other class,
whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter placed in
contrast with him is the most melancholy evidence of degradation in
British feeling and intellect which the times have furnished.


260. _September_ 1, 1802. [Sonnet IX.]

Among the capricious acts of tyranny that disgraced these times was the
chasing of all negroes from France by decree of the Government; we had a
fellow-passenger who was one of the expelled.


261. *'_Two Voices are there,' &c._ [Sonnet XII.]

This was composed while pacing to and fro between the Hall of Coleorton,
then rebuilding, and the principal Farm-house of the Estate, in which we
lived for nine or ten months. I will here mention that the Song on the
Restoration of Lord Clifford, as well as that on the Feast of Brougham
Castle as mentioned [in the place], were produced on the same ground.


262. *'_O Friend! I know not which Way_.' [Sonnet XIII.]

This was written immediately after my return from France to London, when
I could not but be struck, as here described, with the vanity and parade
of our own country, especially in great towns and cities, as contrasted
with the quiet, and I may say the desolation, that the Revolution had
produced in France. This must be borne in mind, or else the reader may
think that in this and succeeding sonnets I have exaggerated the
mischief engendered and fostered among us by undisturbed wealth.

[In pencil--Query: Sonnets relating to the expected Invasion, &c., p.
189, vol. iii. (1837) to p. 200; Ode, p. 201 to 203; Sonnets, part
second, p. 204 to 215]. [After three blank pages.]


263. *_War in Spain_.

It would not be easy to conceive with what a depth of feeling I entered
into the struggle carried on by the Spaniards for their deliverance from
the usurped power of the French. Many times have I gone from Allan Bank,
in Grasmere Vale, where we were then residing, to the top of the
Raise-Gap, as it is called, so late as two o'clock in the morning, to
meet the carrier bringing the newspaper from Keswick. Imperfect traces
of the state of mind in which I then was may be found in my tract on the
Convention of Cintra, as well as in these Sonnets.


264. *_Zaragossa_. [Sonnet XVI.]

In this sonnet I am under some obligations to one of an Italian author,
to which I cannot refer.


265. *_Lines on the expected Invasion_, 1803. [Sonnet XXVI.]

To take their place among the political pieces.


266. _Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke_. [Sonnet XXVII.]

    'Danger which they fear, and honour which they understand not.'

Words in Lord Brooke's Life of Sir Philip Sidney.

So in the 'Thanksgiving Ode' (vi. 10) on 'And discipline was passion's
dire excess' is quoted, 'Discipline the rule whereof is passion.'


267. _The Oak of Guernica_. [Part II. Sonnet XXVI.]

The ancient oak of Guernica, says Laborde, in his account of Biscay, is
a most venerable natural monument. Ferdinand and Isabella, in the year
1476, after hearing mass in the church of Santa Maria de la Antigua,
repaired to this tree, under which they swore to the Biscayans to
maintain their _fueros_ (privileges). What other interest belongs to it
in the minds of the people will appear from the following 'Supposed
Address to the Same.'


268. _Thanksgiving Ode_. [Part II. XLVI.]

Wholly unworthy of touching upon the momentous subject here treated
would that Poet be, before whose eyes the present distresses under which
this kingdom labours could interpose a veil sufficiently thick to hide,
or even to obscure, the splendour of this great moral triumph. If I have
given way to exultation, unchecked by these distresses, it might be
sufficient to protect me from a charge of insensibility, should I state
my own belief that the sufferings will be transitory. Upon the wisdom of
a very large majority of the British nation rested that generosity which
poured out the treasures of this country for the deliverance of Europe;
and in the same national wisdom, presiding in time of peace over an
energy not inferior to that which has been displayed in war, _they_
confide who encourage a firm hope that the cup of our wealth will be
gradually replenished. There will, doubtless, be no few ready to indulge
in regrets and repinings; and to feed a morbid satisfaction by
aggravating these burthens in imagination; in order that calamity so
confidently prophesied, as it has not taken the shape which their
sagacity allotted to it, may appear as grievous as possible under
another. But the body of the nation will not quarrel with the gain,
because it might have been purchased at a less price; and, acknowledging
in these sufferings, which they feel to have been in a great degree
unavoidable, a consecration of their noble efforts, they will vigorously
apply themselves to remedy the evil.

Nor is it at the expense of rational patriotism, or in disregard of
sound philosophy, that I have given vent to feelings tending to
encourage a martial spirit in the bosoms of my countrymen, at a time
when there is a general outcry against the prevalence of these
dispositions. The British army, both by its skill and valour in the
field, and by the discipline which rendered it, to the inhabitants of
the several countries where its operations were carried on, a protection
from the violence of their own troops, has performed services that will
not allow the language of gratitude and admiration to be suppressed or
restrained (whatever be the temper of the public mind) through a
scrupulous dread lest the tribute due to the past should prove an
injurious incentive for the future. Every man deserving the name of
Briton adds his voice to the chorus which extols the exploits of his
countrymen, with a consciousness, at times overpowering the effort, that
they transcend all praise.--But this particular sentiment, thus
irresistibly excited, is not sufficient. The nation would err
grievously, if she suffered the abuse which other States have made of
military power to prevent her from perceiving that no people ever was or
can be independent, free, or secure, much less great, in any sane
application of the word, without a cultivation of military virtues. Nor
let it be overlooked, that the benefits derivable from these sources are
placed within the reach of Great Britain, under conditions peculiarly
favourable. The same insular position which, by rendering territorial
incorporation impossible, utterly precludes the desire of conquest under
the most seductive shape it can assume, enables her to rely, for her
defence against foreign foes, chiefly upon a species of armed force from
which her own liberties have nothing to fear. Such are the privileges of
her situation; and, by permitting, they invite her to give way to the
courageous instincts of human nature, and to strengthen and refine them
by culture.

But some have more than insinuated that a design exists to subvert the
civil character of the English people by unconstitutional applications
and unnecessary increase of military power. The advisers and abettors of
such a design, were it possible that it should exist, would be guilty of
the most heinous crime, which, upon this planet, can be committed.
Trusting that this apprehension arises from the delusive influences of
an honourable jealousy, let me hope that the martial qualities which I
venerate will be fostered by adhering to those good old usages which
experience has sanctioned; and by availing ourselves of new means of
indisputable promise: particularly by applying, in its utmost possible
extent, that system of tuition whose master-spring is a habit of
gradually enlightened subordination;--by imparting knowledge, civil,
moral, and religious, in such measure that the mind, among all classes
of the community, may love, admire, and be prepared and accomplished to
defend, that country under whose protection its faculties have been
unfolded, and its riches acquired:--by just dealing towards all orders
of the State, so that no members of it being trampled upon, courage may
everywhere continue to rest immoveably upon its ancient English
foundation, personal self-respect;--by adequate rewards, and permanent
honours, conferred upon the deserving;--by encouraging athletic
exercises and manly sports among the peasantry of the country;--and by
especial care to provide and support institutions, in which, during a
time of peace, a reasonable proportion of the youth of the country may
be instructed in military science.

I have only to add, that I should feel little satisfaction in giving to
the world these limited attempts to celebrate the virtues of my country,
if I did not encourage a hope that a subject, which it has fallen within
my province to treat only in the mass, will by other poets be
illustrated in that detail which its importance calls for, and which
will allow opportunities to give the merited applause to PERSONS as well
as to THINGS.

The ode was published along with other pieces, now interspersed through
this Volume.


269. *_Ibid._

The first stanza of this Ode was composed almost extempore, in front of
Rydal Mount before Church-time, on such a morning and precisely with
such objects before my eyes as are here described. The view taken of
Napoleon's character and proceedings is little in accordance with that
taken by some Historians and critical philosophers. I am glad and proud
of the difference, and trust that this series of Poems, infinitely below
the subject as they are, will survive to counteract in unsophisticated
minds the pernicious and degrading tendency of those views and doctrines
that lead to the idolatry of power as power, and in that false splendour
to lose sight of its real nature and constitution, as it often acts for
the gratification of its possessor without reference to a beneficial
end--an infirmity that has characterised men of all ages, classes, and
employments, since Nimrod became a mighty hunter before the Lord, [In
pencil is the following by Mr. Quillinan--In a letter to Southey about
the rhythm of this Ode Wordsworth, comparing the first paragraph of the
'Aeneid' with that of the 'Jerusalem Liberated,' says, that 'the measure
of the latter has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling to vulgar
music upon a parade, and receiving from the adjutant or drill-sergeant
the command to halt at every twenty steps.' Mr. W. had no ear for
instrumental music; or he would not have applied this vulgar sarcasm to
military march-music. Besides, awkward recruits are never drilled to
music at all. The Band on parade plays to perfectly-drilled troops. Ne
sutor ultra crepidam.]


270. _Spenser_. [Part II. Sonnet XLIII.]

    'Assoiled from all encumbrance of our time.'
    'From all this world's encumbrance did himself assoil.'

       *       *       *       *       *




XI. MEMORIALS OF A TOUR ON THE CONTINENT, 1820.


271. *_Introductory Remarks_.

I set out in company with my wife and sister, and Mr. and Mrs.
Monkhouse, then just married, and Miss Horrocks. These two ladies,
sisters, we left at Berne, while Mr. Monkhouse took the opportunity of
making an excursion with us among the Alps, as far as Milan. Mr. H. C.
Robinson joined us at Lucerne, and when this ramble was completed we
rejoined at Geneva the two ladies we had left at Berne, and proceeded to
Paris, where Mr. Monkhouse and H. C. R. left us, and where we spent five
weeks, of which there is not a record in these poems.


272. _The Fishwomen of Calais_, [I.]

If in this Sonnet [I. of 'Memorials of a Tour on the Continent,' 1820] I
should seem to have borne a little hard upon the personal appearance of
the worthy Poissardes of Calais, let me take shelter under the authority
of my lamented friend, the late Sir George Beaumont. He, a most accurate
observer, used to say of them, that their features and countenances
seemed to have conformed to those of the creatures they dealt in; at
all events the resemblance was striking.


273. *_Incident at Bruges_. [IV.]

This occurred at Bruges in the year 1828. Mr. Coleridge, my daughter,
and I, made a tour together in Flanders, upon the Rhine, and returned by
Holland. Dora and I, while taking a walk along a retired part of the
town, heard the voice as here described, and were afterwards informed
that it was a convent, in which were many English. We were both much
touched, I might say affected, and Dora moved as appears in the verses.


274. _Between Namur and Liege_. [VI.]

The scenery on the Meuse pleases me more, upon the whole, than that of
the Rhine, though the river itself is much inferior in grandeur. The
rocks, both in form and colour, especially between Namur and Liege,
surpass any upon the Rhine, though they are in several places disfigured
by quarries, whence stones were taken for the new fortifications. This
is much to be regretted, for they are useless, and the scars will
remain, perhaps, for thousands of years. A like injury to a still
greater degree has been inflicted, in my memory, upon the beautiful
rocks at Clifton, on the banks of the Avon. There is probably in
existence a very long letter of mine to Sir Uvedale Price, in which was
given a description of the landscapes on the Meuse as compared with
those on the Rhine.

Details in the spirit of these sonnets are given both in Mary's Journal
and my sister's; and the reperusal of them has strengthened a wish long
entertained, that somebody would put together, as in one work, the notes
contained in them, omitting particulars that were written down merely to
aid our memory, and bringing the whole into as small a compass as is
consistent with the general interests belonging to the scenes,
circumstances, and objects touched on by each writer.


275. '_Miserere Domine_.' [X.]

See the beautiful song on Mr. Coleridge's Tragedy, 'The Remorse.' Why is
the harp of Quantock silent?


276. _The Danube_. [XI.]

    'Not, like his great Compeers, indignantly
    Doth Danube spring to life!'

Before this quarter of the Black Forest was inhabited, the source of the
Danube might have suggested some of those sublime images which Armstrong
has so finely described; at present, the contrast is most striking. The
Spring appears in a capacious stone Basin in front of a Ducal palace,
with a pleasure-ground opposite; then, passing under the pavement, takes
the form of a little, clear, bright, black, vigorous rill, barely wide
enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old to leap over
it,--and entering the garden, it joins, after a course of a few hundred
yards, a stream much more considerable than itself. The _copiousness_ of
the spring at _Doneschingen_ must have procured for it the honour of
being named the Source of the Danube.


277. _The Staub-bach_. [XII.]

'The Staub-bach' is a narrow Stream, which, after a long course on the
heights, comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat overhanging precipice,
overleaps it with a bound, and, after a fall of 930 feet, forms again a
rivulet. The vocal powers of these musical Beggars may seem to be
exaggerated; but this wild and savage air was utterly unlike any sounds
I had ever heard; the notes reached me from a distance, and on what
occasion they were sung I could not guess, only they seemed to belong,
in some way or other, to the Waterfall--and reminded me of religious
services chanted to Streams and Fountains in Pagan times. Mr. Southey
has thus accurately characterised the peculiarity of this music: 'While
we were at the Waterfall, some half-score peasants, chiefly women and
girls, assembled just out of reach of the Spring, and set up--surely,
the wildest chorus that ever was heard by human ears,--a song not of
articulate sounds, but in which the voice was used as a mere instrument
of music, more flexible than any which art could produce,--sweet,
powerful, and thrilling beyond description.'--See Notes to 'A Tale of
Paraguay.'


278. _Memorial near the Outlet of the Lake of Thun_. [XIV.]

        Dem
      Andenken
    Meines Freundes
     ALOYS REDING
      MDCCCXVIII.

Aloys Reding, it will be remembered, was Captain-General of the Swiss
Forces, which with a courage and perseverance worthy of the cause,
opposed the flagitious and too successful attempt of Buonaparte to
subjugate their country.


279. _Engelbery_. [XVIII.]

The Convent whose site was pointed out, according to tradition, in this
manner, is seated at its base. The architecture of the building is
unimpressive, but the situation is worthy of the honour which the
imagination of the mountaineers has conferred upon it.


280. _Our Lady of the Snow_. [XIX.]

Mount Righi.


281. _Effusion in presence of the painted Tower of Tell at Altorf_.
[XX.]

This Tower stands upon the spot where grew the Linden Tree against which
his Son is said to have been placed, when the Father's archery was put
to proof under circumstances so famous in Swiss Story.


282. _The Town of Schwytz_. [XXI.]

Nearly 500 years (says Ebel, speaking of the French Invasion) had
elapsed, when, for the first time, foreign soldiers were seen upon the
frontiers of this small Canton, to impose upon it the laws of their
governors.


283. _The Church of San Salvador, seen from the Lake of Lugano_. [XXIV.]

This Church was almost destroyed by lightning a few years ago, but the
altar and the image of the Patron Saint were untouched. The Mount, upon
the summit of which the Church is built, stands amid the intricacies of
the Lake of Lugano; and is, from a hundred points of view, its principal
ornament, rising to the height of 2000 feet, and, on one side, nearly
perpendicular. The ascent is toilsome; but the traveller who performs it
will be amply rewarded. Splendid fertility, rich woods and dazzling
waters, seclusion and confinement of view contrasted with sea-like
extent of plain fading into the sky; and this again, in an opposite
quarter, with an horizon of the loftiest and boldest Alps--unite in
composing a prospect more diversified by magnificence, beauty, and
sublimity, than perhaps any other point in Europe, of so inconsiderable
an elevation, commands.


284. _Foot-note on lines_ 31-36.

    'He, too, of battle martyrs chief!
    Who, to recall his daunted peers,
    For victory shaped an open space,
    By gathering with a wide embrace,
    Into his single breast, a sheaf
    Of fatal Austrian spears.'

Arnold Winkelried, at the battle of Sampach, broke an Austrian phalanx
in this manner.


285. _'The Last Supper' of Leonardo da Vinci_. [xxvi.]

    'Though searching damps and many an envious flaw
    Have marred this Work.'

This picture of the Last Supper has not only been grievously injured by
time, but the greatest part of it, if not the whole, is said to have
been retouched, or painted over again. These niceties may be left to
connoisseurs,--I speak of it as I felt. The copy exhibited in London
some years ago, and the engraving by Morghen, are both admirable; but in
the original is a power which neither of those works has attained, or
even approached.


286. _Statues on Milan Cathedral_. [XXVII.]

    'Of figures human and divine.'

The Statues ranged round the spire and along the roof of the Cathedral
of Milan, have been found fault with by persons whose exclusive taste is
unfortunate for themselves. It is true that the same expense and labour,
judiciously directed to purposes more strictly architectural, might
have much heightened the general effect of the building; for, seen from
the ground, the Statues appear diminutive. But the _coup-d'oeil_, from
the best point of view, which is half way up the spire, must strike an
unprejudiced person with admiration; and surely the selection and
arrangement of the Figures is exquisitely fitted to support the religion
of the country in the imaginations and feelings of the spectator. It was
with great pleasure that I saw, during the two ascents which we made,
several children, of different ages, tripping up and down the slender
spire, and pausing to look around them, with feelings much more animated
than could have been derived from these or the finest works of art, if
placed within easy reach.--Remember also that you have the Alps on one
side, and on the other the Apennines, with the plain of Lombardy
between!


287. _A Religious Procession_. [XXXII.]

    'Still, with those white-robed Shapes--a living Stream,
    The glacier pillars join in solemn guise.'

This Procession is a part of the sacramental service performed once a
month. In the valley of Engleberg we had the good fortune to be present
at the _Grand Festival_ of the Virgin--but the Procession on that day,
though consisting of upwards of 1000 persons, assembled from all the
branches of the sequestered valley, was much less striking
(notwithstanding the sublimity of the surrounding scenery): it wanted
both the simplicity of the other and the accompaniment of the
Glacier-columns, whose sisterly resemblance to the _moving_ Figures gave
it a most beautiful and solemn peculiarity.


288. _Elegiac Stanzas_. [XXXIII.]

The lamented Youth whose untimely death gave occasion to these elegiac
verses was Frederick William Goddard, from Boston in North America. He
was in his twentieth year, and had resided for some time with a
clergyman in the neighbourhood of Geneva for the completion of his
education. Accompanied by a fellow-pupil, a native of Scotland, he had
just set out on a Swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with
a friend of mine who was hastening to join our party. The travellers,
after spending a day together on the road from Berne and at Soleure,
took leave of each other at night, the young men having intended to
proceed directly to Zurich. But early in the morning my friend found his
new acquaintances, who were informed of the object of his journey, and
the friends he was in pursuit of, equipped to accompany him. We met at
Lucerne the succeeding evening, and Mr. G. and his fellow-student became
in consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days. We
ascended the Righi together; and, after contemplating the sunrise from
that noble mountain, we separated at an hour and on a spot well suited
to the parting of those who were to meet no more. Our party descended
through the valley of our Lady of the Snow, and our late companions, to
Art. We had hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva; but on the third
succeeding day (on the 21st of August) Mr. Goddard perished, being
overset in a boat while crossing the lake of Zurich. His companion saved
himself by swimming, and was hospitably received in the mansion of a
Swiss gentleman (M. Keller) situated on the eastern coast of the lake.
The corpse of poor Goddard was cast ashore on the estate of the same
gentleman, who generously performed all the rites of hospitality which
could be rendered to the dead as well as to the living. He caused a
handsome mural monument to be erected in the church of Küsnacht, which
records the premature fate of the young American, and on the shores too
of the lake the traveller may read an inscription pointing out the spot
where the body was deposited by the waves.


289. _Mount Righi_ (foot-note).

    --'the dread summit of the Queen
    Of Mountains.'

Mount Righi--Regina Montium.


290. _The Tower of Caligula_. [XXXV.]

Near the town of Boulogne, and overhanging the beach, are the remains of
a tower which bears the name of Caligula, who here terminated his
western expedition, of which these sea-shells were the boasted spoils.
And at no great distance from these ruins, Buonaparte, standing upon a
mound of earth, harangued his 'Army of England,' reminding them of the
exploits of Caesar, and pointing towards the white cliffs, upon which
their standards _were to float_. He recommended also a subscription to
be raised among the Soldiery to erect on that ground, in memory of the
foundation of the 'Legion of Honour,' a Column--which was not completed
at the time we were there.


291. _Herds of Cattle_. [XXXVI.]

    'We mark majestic herds of cattle, free
    To ruminate.'

This is a most grateful sight for an Englishman returning to his native
land. Every where one misses in the cultivated grounds abroad, the
animated and soothing accompaniment of animals ranging and selecting
their own food at will.


292. _The Forks_. ['Desultory Stanzas,' l. 37.]

Les Fourches, the point at which the two chains of mountains part, that
enclose the Valais, which terminates at St. Maurice.


292[a]. _The Landenberg_. [Ibid. ll. 49-51.]

    --'ye that occupy
    Your Council-seats beneath the open sky,
    On Sarnen's Mount.'

Sarnen, one of the two capitals of the Canton of Underwalden; the spot
here alluded to is close to the town, and is called the Landenberg, from
the tyrant of that name, whose chateau formerly stood there. On the 1st
of January 1308, the great day which the confederated Heroes had chosen
for the deliverance of their country, all the castles of the Governors
were taken by force or stratagem; and the Tyrants themselves conducted,
with their creatures, to the frontiers, after having witnessed the
destruction of their strong-holds. From that time the Landenberg has
been the place where the Legislators of this division of the Canton
assemble. The site, which is well described by Ebel, is one of the most
beautiful in Switzerland.


293. _Pictures in Bridges of Switzerland_. [Ibid. l. 56.]

    'Calls me to pace her honoured Bridge.'

The bridges of Lucerne are roofed, and open at the sides, so that the
passenger has, at the same time, the benefit of shade, and a view of the
magnificent country. The pictures are attached to the rafters; those
from Scripture History, on the Cathedral-bridge, amount, according to my
notes, to 240. Subjects from the Old Testament face the passenger as he
goes towards the Cathedral, and those from the New as he returns. The
pictures on these bridges, as well as those in most other parts of
Switzerland, are not to be spoken of as works of art; but they are
instruments admirably answering the purpose for which they were
designed.


294. *_At Dover_. [XXXVII.]

For the impressions on which this Sonnet turns I am indebted to the
experience of my daughter during her residence at Dover with our dear
friend Miss Fenwick.

       *       *       *       *       *




XII. MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN ITALY, 1837.


295. *_Introductory Remarks_.

During my whole life I had felt a strong desire to visit Rome and the
other celebrated cities and regions of Italy, but did not think myself
justified in incurring the necessary expense till I received from Mr.
Moxon, the publisher of a large edition of my poems, a sum sufficient to
enable me to gratify my wish without encroaching upon what I considered
due to my family. My excellent friend H.C. Robinson readily consented to
accompany me, and in March 1837 we set off from London, to which we
returned in August--earlier than my companion wished, or I should myself
have desired, had I been, like him, a bachelor. These Memorials of that
Tour touch upon but a very few of the places and objects that interested
me; and in what they do advert to are for the most part much slighter
than I could wish. More particularly do I regret that there is no notice
in them of the south of France, nor of the Roman antiquities abounding
in that district; especially of the Pont de Degard, which, together with
its situation, impressed me full as much as any remains of Roman
architecture to be found in Italy. Then there was Vaucluse, with its
fountain, its Petrarch, its rocks [query--roses?] of all seasons, its
small plots of lawn in their first vernal freshness, and the blossoms of
the peach and other trees embellishing the scene on every side. The
beauty of the stream also called forcibly for the expression of sympathy
from one who from his childhood had studied the brooks and torrents of
his native mountains. Between two and three hours did I run about,
climbing the steep and rugged craggs, from whose base the water of
Vaucluse breaks forth. 'Has Laura's lover,' often said I to myself,
'ever sat down upon this stone? Or has his foot ever pressed that turf?'
Some, especially of the female sex, could have felt sure of it; my
answer was (impute it to my years), 'I fear, not.' Is it not in fact
obvious that many of his love-verses must have flowed, I do not say from
a wish to display his own talent, but from a habit of exercising his
intellect in that way, rather than from an impulse of his heart? It is
otherwise with his Lyrical Poems, and particularly with the one upon the
degradation of his country. There he pours out his reproaches,
lamentations, and aspirations like an ardent and sincere patriot. But
enough; it is time to turn to my own effusions, such as they are.


296. _Ibid._

The Tour, of which the following Poems are very inadequate remembrances,
was shortened by report, too well founded, of the prevalence of cholera
at Naples. To make some amends for what was reluctantly left unseen in
the south of Italy, we visited the Tuscan Sanctuaries among the
Apennines, and the principal Italian Lakes among the Alps. Neither of
those lakes, nor of Venice, is there any notice in these poems, chiefly
because I have touched upon them elsewhere. See in particular
'Descriptive Sketches,' 'Memorials of a Tour on the Continent in 1820,'
and a Sonnet upon the extinction of the Venetian Republic.


297. *_Musings at Aquapendente, April _1837. [I.]

The following note refers to Sir W. Scott:

    'Had his sunk eye kindled at those dear words
    That spake of Bards and Minstrels' (ll. 60-1).

_His_, Sir W. Scott's, eye _did_ in fact kindle at them, for the lines
'Places forsaken now,' and the two that follow, were adopted from a poem
of mine, which nearly forty years ago was in part read to him, and he
never forgot them.

          'Old Helvellyn's brow,
    Where once together in his day of strength
    We stood rejoicing' (ll. 62-4).

Sir Hy. Davy was with us at the time. We had ascended from Paterdale,
and I could not but admire the vigour with which Scott scrambled along
that horn of the mountain called 'Striding Edge.' Our progress was
necessarily slow, and beguiled by Scott's telling many stories and
amusing anecdotes, as was his custom. Sir H. Davy would have probably
been better pleased if other topics had occasionally been interspersed
and some discussion entered upon; at all events, he did not remain with
us long at the top of the mountain, but left us to find our way down its
steep side together into the vale of Grasmere, where at my cottage Mrs.
Scott was to meet us at dinner. He said:

    'When I am there, although 'tis fair,
    'Twill be another Yarrow.'

See among these Notes the one upon Yarrow Revisited. [In the printed
Notes there is the following farther reference to the touching quotation
by Scott--These words were quoted to me from 'Yarrow Unvisited' by Sir
Walter Scott, when I visited him at Abbotsford, a day or two before his
departure for Italy; and the affecting condition in which he was when he
looked upon Rome from the Janicular Mount was reported to me by a lady
who had the honour of conducting him thither.]


298.
    A few short steps, painful they were, apart From
    Tasso's convent-haven and retired grave'_(ll. 83-5).

This, though introduced here, I did not know till it was told me at Rome
by Miss Mackenzie of Seaforth, a lady whose friendly attentions, during
my residence at Rome, I have gratefully acknowledged with expressions of
sincere regret that she is no more. Miss M. told me that she had
accompanied Sir Walter to the Janicular Mount, and, after showing him
the grave of Tasso in the church upon the top, and a mural monument
there erected to his memory, they left the church, and stood together on
the brow of the hill overlooking the city of Rome. His daughter Anne was
with them, and she, naturally desirous, for the sake of Miss Mackenzie
especially, to have some expression of pleasure from her father, half
reproached him for showing nothing of that kind either by his looks or
voice. 'How can I,' replied he, 'having only one leg to stand upon, and
that in extreme pain?' so that the prophecy was more than fulfilled.


299. '_Over waves rough and deep_' (line 122).

We took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right horn of the
bay, which makes a sort of natural port for Genoa; but the wind was
high, and the waves long and rough, so that I did not feel quite
recompensed by the view of the city, splendid as it was, for the danger
apparently incurred. The boatman (I had only one) encouraged me, saying,
we were quite safe; but I was not a little glad when we gained the
shore, though Shelley and Byron--one of them at least who seemed to have
courted agitation from every quarter--would have probably rejoiced in
such a situation. More than once, I believe, were they both in extreme
danger even on the Lake of Geneva. Every man, however, has his fears of
some kind or other, and, no doubt, they had theirs. Of all men whom I
have ever known, Coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily
trial, but no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required
in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of social
life.


300.

    '_How lovely_--_didst thou appear, Savona_' (ll. 209-11).

There is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might not
raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there; each as it
succeeds seems more inviting than the other; but the desolated convent
on the cliff in the bay of Savona struck my fancy most; and had I, for
the sake of my own health or of that of a dear friend, or any other
cause, been desirous of a residence abroad, I should have let my
thoughts loose upon a scheme of turning some part of this building into
a habitation, provided as far as might be with English comforts. There
is close by it a row, or avenue (I forget which), of tall cypresses. I
could not forbear saying to myself, 'What a sweet family walk, or one
for lonely musings, would be found under the shade!' but there probably
the trees remain little noticed and seldom enjoyed.


301. /p '_This flowering Broom's dear Neighbourhood_' (l. 378). p/

The Broom is a great ornament through the months of March and April to
the vales and hills of the Apennines, in the wild part of which it blows
in the utmost profusion, and of course successively at different
elevations as the season advances. It surpasses ours in beauty and
fragrance; but, speaking from my own limited observation only, I cannot
affirm the same of several of their wild Spring flowers, the primroses
in particular, which I saw not unfrequently but thinly scattered and
languishing as compared with ours.


302. _The Religious Movement in the English Church_.

In the printed Notes there is the following on Aquapendente: 'It would
be ungenerous not to advert to the religious movement that, since the
composition of these verses in 1837, has made itself felt, more or less
strongly, throughout the English Church; a movement that takes for its
first principle a devout deference to the voice of Christian antiquity.
It is not my office to pass judgment on questions of theological detail;
but my own repugnance to the spirit and system of Romanism has been so
repeatedly, and I trust feelingly, expressed that I shall not be
suspected of a leaning that way, if I do not join in the grave charges,
thrown out, perhaps, in the heat of controversy, against the learned and
pious men to whose labours I allude. I speak apart from controversy, but
with a strong faith in the moral temper which would elevate the present
by doing reverence to the past. I would draw cheerful auguries for the
English Church from this movement as likely to restore among us a tone
of piety more earnest and real than that produced by the mere
formalities of the understanding, refusing, in a degree which I cannot
but lament, that its own temper and judgment shall be controlled by
those of antiquity.' From the I.F. MSS. we learn that the preceding note
was written by the Rev. F.W. Faber, D.D., as thus: 'The Note at the
close of the poem upon the Oxford movement was intrusted to my friend
Mr. Frederick Faber. I told him what I wished to be said, and begged
that as he was intimately acquainted with several of the Leaders of it,
he would express my thought in the way least likely to be taken amiss
by them. Much of the work they are undertaking was grievously wanted,
and God grant their endeavours may continue to prosper as they have
done.'


302[a]. *'_The Pine-tree of Monte Mario_,' [II.]

Rescued by Sir G. Beaumont from destruction. Sir G. Beaumont told me
that when he first visited Italy, pine-trees of this species abounded;
but that on his return thither, which was more than thirty years after,
they had disappeared from many places where he had been accustomed to
admire them, and had become rare all over the country, especially in and
about Rome. Several Roman villas have within these few years passed into
the hands of foreigners, who, I observed with pleasure, have taken care
to plant this tree, which in course of years will become a great
ornament to the city and to the general landscape.

May I venture to add here, that having ascended the Monte Mario I could
not resist embracing the trunk of this interesting monument of my
departed friend's feelings for the beauties of nature and the power of
that art which he loved so much and in the practice of which he was so
distinguished.

[Among the printed Notes is the following--Within a couple of hours of
my arrival at Rome, I saw from Monte Pincio the Pine-tree as described
in the Sonnet; and while expressing admiration at the beauty of its
appearance, I was told by an acquaintance of my fellow-traveller, who
happened to join us at the moment, that a price had been paid for it by
the late Sir G. Beaumont, upon condition that the proprietor should not
act upon his known intention of cutting it down.]


303. '_Is this, ye gods_.' [III. l. 1.]

Sight is at first a sad enemy to imagination, and to those pleasures
belonging to old times with which some exertions of that power will
always mingle. Nothing perhaps brings this truth home to the feelings
more than the city of Rome, not so much in respect to the impression
made at the moment when it is first seen and looked at as a whole, for
then the imagination may be invigorated, and the mind's eye quickened to
perceive as much as that of the imagination; but when particular spots
or objects are sought out, disappointment is, I believe, invariably
felt. Ability to recover from this disappointment will exist in
proportion to knowledge, and the power of the mind to reconstruct out of
fragments and parts, and to make details in the present subservient to
more adequate comprehension of the past.


304. '_At Rome_.'

    'They who have seen the noble Roman's scorn.' [VII. l. 1.]

I have a private interest in this sonnet, for I doubt whether it would
ever have been written, but for the lively picture given me by Anna
Ricketts of what they had witnessed of the indignation and sorrow
expressed by some Italian noblemen of their acquaintance upon the
surrender, which circumstances had obliged them to make, of the best
portion of their family mansions to strangers.


305. *_At Albano_. [IX]

This sonnet is founded on simple fact, and was written to enlarge, if
possible, the views of those who can see nothing but evil in the
intercessions countenanced by the Church of Rome. That they are in many
respects lamentably pernicious must be acknowledged; but, on the other
hand, they who reflect while they see and observe cannot but be struck
with instances which will prove that it is a great error to condemn in
all cases such mediation, as purely idolatrous. This remark bears with
especial force upon addresses to the Virgin.


306. *_Cuckoo at Laverna_. [XIV.]

May 25th, 1837. Among a thousand delightful feelings connected in my
mind with the voice of the cuckoo, there is a personal one which is
rather melancholy. I was first convinced that age had rather dulled my
hearing, by not being able to catch the sound at the same distance as
the younger companions of my walks; and of this failure I had proof upon
the occasion that suggested these verses. I did not hear the sound till
Mr. Robinson had twice or thrice directed my attention to it.


307. _Camaldoli_. [XV.]

This famous sanctuary was the original establishment of Saint Romualdo,
(or Rumwald, as our ancestors saxonised the name) in the 11th century,
the ground (campo) being given by a Count Maldo. The Camaldolensi,
however, have spread wide as a branch of Benedictines, and may therefore
be classed among the _gentlemen_ of the monastic orders. The society
comprehends two orders, monks and hermits; symbolised by their arms, two
doves drinking out of the same cup. The monastery in which the monks
here reside is beautifully situated, but a large unattractive edifice,
not unlike a factory. The hermitage is placed in a loftier and wilder
region of the forest. It comprehends between 20 and 30 distinct
residences, each including for its single hermit an inclosed piece of
ground and three very small apartments. There are days of indulgence
when the hermit may quit his cell, and when old age arrives, he descends
from the mountain and takes his abode among the monks.

My companion had, in the year 1831, fallen in with the monk, the subject
of these two sonnets, who showed him his abode among the hermits. It is
from him that I received the following particulars. He was then about 40
years of age, but his appearance was that of an older man. He had been a
painter by profession, but on taking orders changed his name from Santi
to Raffaello, perhaps with an unconscious reference as well to the great
Sanzio d'Urbino as to the archangel. He assured my friend that he had
been 13 years in the hermitage and had never known melancholy or ennui.
In the little recess for study and prayer, there was a small collection
of books. 'I read only,' said he, 'books of asceticism and mystical
theology.' On being asked the names of the most famous mystics, he
enumerated _Scaramelli, San Giovanni della Croce, St. Dionysius the
Areopayite_ (supposing the work which bears his name to be really his),
and with peculiar emphasis _Ricardo di San Vittori_. The works of _Saint
Theresa _are also in high repute among ascetics. These names may
interest some of my readers.

We heard that Raffaello was then living in the convent; my friend sought
in vain to renew his acquaintance with him. It was probably a day of
seclusion. The reader will perceive that these sonnets were supposed to
be written when he was a young man.


308. _Monk-visitors of Camaldoli_.

    'What aim had they the pair of Monks?' (XVII. l. 1.)

In justice to the Benedictines of Camaldoli, by whom strangers are so
hospitably entertained, I feel obliged to notice, that I saw among them
no other figures at all resembling, in size and complexion, the two
monks described in this Sonnet. What was their office, or the motive
which brought them to this place of mortification, which they could not
have approached without being carried in this or some other way, a
feeling of delicacy prevented me from inquiring. An account has before
been given of the hermitage they were about to enter. It was visited by
us towards the end of the month of May; yet snow was lying thick under
the pine-trees, within a few yards of the gate.


309. *_At Vallombrosa_. [XVIII.]

I must confess, though of course I did not acknowledge it in the few
lines I wrote in the strangers' book kept at the Convent, that I was
somewhat disappointed at Vallombrosa. I had expected, as the name
implies, a deep and narrow valley, over-shadowed by enclosing hills: but
the spot where the convent stands is in fact not a valley at all, but a
cove or crescent open to an extensive prospect. In the book before
mentioned I read the notice in the English language, that if any one
would ascend the steep ground above the convent, and wander over it, he
would be abundantly rewarded by magnificent views. I had not time to act
upon the recommendation, and only went with my young guide to a point,
nearly on a level with the site of the convent, that overlooks the Vale
of Arno for some leagues.

To praise great and good men has ever been deemed one of the worthiest
employments of poetry; but the objects of admiration vary so much with
time and circumstances, and the noblest of mankind have been found, when
intimately known, to be of characters so imperfect, that no eulogist can
find a subject which he will venture upon with the animation necessary
to create sympathy, unless he confines himself to a particular act, or
he takes something of a one-sided view of the person he is disposed to
celebrate. This is a melancholy truth, and affords a strong reason for
the poetic mind being chiefly exercised in works of fiction. The poet
can then follow wherever the spirit of admiration leads him, unchecked
by such suggestions as will be too apt to cross his way if all that he
is prompted to utter is to be tested by fact. Something in this spirit I
have written in the note attached to the Sonnet on the King of Sweden;
and many will think that in this poem, and elsewhere, I have spoken of
the author of 'Paradise Lost' in a strain of panegyric scarcely
justifiable by the tenour of some of his opinions, whether theological
or political, and by the temper he carried into public affairs, in
which, unfortunately for his genius, he was so much concerned.

[Among the printed Notes is this--The name of Milton is pleasingly
connected with Vallombrosa in many ways. The pride with which the Monk,
without any previous question from me, pointed out his residence, I
shall not readily forget. It may be proper here to defend the Poet from
a charge which has been brought against him, in respect to the passage
in 'Paradise Lost' where this place is mentioned. It is said, that he
has erred in speaking of the trees there being deciduous, whereas they
are, in fact, pines. The fault-finders are themselves mistaken: the
natural woods of the region of Vallombrosa are deciduous and spread to a
great extent; those near the convent are, indeed, mostly pines; but they
are avenues of trees planted within a few steps of each other, and thus
composing large tracts of wood, plots of which are periodically cut
down. The appearance of those narrow avenues, upon steep slopes open to
the sky, on account of the height which the trees attain by being forced
to grow upwards, is often very impressive. My guide, a boy of about
fourteen years old, pointed this out to me in several places.]


310. *_Sonnet at Florence_. [XIX.]

    'Under the shadow of a stately pile.'

Upon what evidence the belief rests that this stone was a favourite seat
of Dante, I do not know; but a man would little consult his own interest
as a traveller, if he should busy himself with doubts as to the fact.
The readiness with which traditions of this character are received, and
the fidelity with which they are preserved from generation to
generation, are an evidence of feelings honourable to our nature. I
remember now, during one of my rambles in the course of a college
vacation, I was pleased at being shown at ---- a seat near a kind of
rocky cell at the source of the river ----, on which it was said that
Congreve wrote his _Old Bachelor_. One can scarcely hit on any
performance less in harmony with the scene; but it was a local tribute
paid to intellect by those who had not troubled themselves to estimate
the moral worth of that author's comedies. And why should they? he was a
man distinguished in his day, and the sequestered neighbourhood in which
he often resided was perhaps as proud of him as Florence of her Dante.
It is the same feeling, though proceeding from persons one cannot bring
together in this way without offering some apology to the shade of the
great visionary.


311. *_The Baptist_. [XX.]

It was very hot weather during the week we stayed at Florence; and,
having never been there before, I went through much hard service, and am
not, therefore, _ashamed_ to confess, I fell asleep before this picture,
and sitting with my back towards the Venus de Medicis. Buonaparte, in
answer to one who had spoken of his being in a sound sleep up to the
moment when one of his great battles was to be fought, as a proof of the
calmness of his mind and command over anxious thoughts, said frankly,
'that he slept because, from bodily exhaustion, he could not help it.'
In like manner it is noticed that criminals, on the night previous to
their execution, seldom awake before they are called, a proof that the
body is the master of us far more than we need be willing to allow.

Should this note by any possible chance be seen by any of my countrymen
who might have been in the Gallery at the time (and several persons were
there) and witnessed such an indecorum, I hope he will give up the
opinion which he might naturally have formed to my prejudice.


312. *_Florence_.

    'Rapt above earth,' and the following one. [XXI.-II.]

However, at first, these two Sonnets from M. Angelo may seem in their
spirit somewhat inconsistent with each other, I have not scrupled to
place them side by side as characteristic of their great author, and
others with whom he lived. I feel, nevertheless, a wish to know at what
periods of his life they were respectively composed. The latter, as it
expresses, was written in his advanced years, when it was natural that
the Platonism that pervades the one should give way to the Christian
feeling that inspired the other. Between both, there is more than poetic
affinity.


312a. *_Among the Ruins of a Convent in the Apennines_. [XXIII.]

The political revolutions of our time have multiplied on the Continent
objects that unavoidably call forth reflections such as are expressed in
these verses, but the ruins in those countries are too recent to exhibit
in anything like an equal degree the beauty with which time and Nature
have invested the remains of our convents and abbeys. These verses, it
will be observed, take up the beauty long before it is matured, as one
cannot but wish it may be among some of the desolations of Italy,
France, and Germany.


313. *_Sonnets after leaving Italy_. [XXV.]

I had proof in several instances that the Carbonari, if I may still call
them so, and their favourers, are opening their eyes to the necessity of
patience, and are intent upon spreading knowledge actively, but quietly
as they can. May they have resolution to continue in this course, for it
is the only one by which they can truly benefit their country.

We left Italy by the way which is called the 'Nuova Strada d'Allemagna,'
to the east of the high passes of the Alps, which take you at once from
Italy into Switzerland. The road leads across several smaller heights,
and winds down different vales in succession, so that it was only by the
accidental sound of a few German words I was aware we had quitted Italy;
and hence the unwelcome shock alluded to in the two or three last lines
of the Sonnet with which this imperfect series concludes.


314. *_Composed at Rydal on May morning_, 1838.

This and the following Sonnet [now XXVI.] were composed on what we call
the 'far terrace' at Rydal Mount, where I have murmured out many
thousands of my verses.


315. *_Pillar of Trajan_. [XXVIII.]

These verses had better, perhaps, be transferred to the class of
'Italian Poems.' I had observed in the newspaper that 'The Pillar of
Trajan' was given as a subject for a Prize Poem in English verse. I had
a wish, perhaps, that my son, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford,
should try his fortune; and I told him so: but he, not having been
accustomed to write verse, wisely declined to enter on the task;
whereupon I showed him these lines as a proof of what might, without
difficulty, be done on such a subject.


316. *_The Egyptian Maid_.

In addition to the short notice prefixed to this poem, it may be worth
while here to say, that it rose out of a few words casually used in
conversation by my nephew Henry Hutchinson. He was describing with great
spirit the appearance and movement of a vessel which he seemed to admire
more than any other he had ever seen, and said her name was the Water
Lily. This plant has been my delight from my boyhood, as I have seen it
floating on the lake; and that conversation put me upon constructing and
composing the poem. Had I not heard those words it would never have been
written. The form of the stanza is new, and is nothing but a repetition
of the first five lines as they were thrown off, and is, perhaps, not
well suited to narrative, and certainly would not have been trusted to
had I thought at the beginning that the poem would have gone to such a
length. [The short note referred to _supra_ is as follows: 'For the
names and persons in the following poem see the _History of the Renowned
Prince Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table_; for the rest the
author is answerable; only it may be proper to add that the Lotus, with
the bust of the goddess appearing to rise out of the full-blown flower,
was suggested by the beautiful work of ancient art once included among
the Townley Marbles, and now in the British Museum.']




XIII. THE RIVER DUDDON: A SERIES OF SONNETS.


317. _Introduction_.

The River Duddon rises upon Wrynose Fell, on the confines of
Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancashire: and, having served as a
boundary to the two last counties for the space of about twenty-five
miles, enters the Irish Sea, between the Isle of Walney and the Lordship
of Millum.


318. '_The River Duddon_.'

A Poet, whose works are not yet known as they deserve to be, thus enters
upon his description of the 'Ruins of Rome:'

                'The rising Sun
    Flames on the ruins in the purer air
    Towering aloft;'

and ends thus--

                'The setting sun displays
    His visible great round, between yon towers,
    As through two shady cliffs.'

Mr. Crowe, in his excellent loco-descriptive Poem, 'Lewesdon Hill,' is
still more expeditious, finishing the whole on a May-morning, before
breakfast.

    'Tomorrow for severer thought, but now
    To breakfast, and keep festival to-day.'

No one believes, or is desired to believe, that those Poems were
actually composed within such limits of time; nor was there any reason
why a prose statement should acquaint the Reader with the plain fact, to
the disturbance of poetic credibility. But, in the present case, I am
compelled to mention, that the above series of Sonnets was the growth of
many years;--the one which stands the 14th was the first produced; and
others were added upon occasional visits to the Stream, or as
recollections of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe
them. In this manner I had proceeded insensibly, without perceiving that
I was trespassing upon ground pre-occupied, at least as far as intention
went, by Mr. Coleridge; who, more than twenty years ago, used to speak
of writing a rural Poem, to be entitled 'The Brook,' of which he has
given a sketch in a recent publication. But a particular subject cannot,
I think, much interfere with a general one; and I have been further
kept from encroaching upon any right Mr. C. may still wish to exercise,
by the restriction which the frame of the Sonnet imposed upon me,
narrowing unavoidably the range of thought, and precluding, though not
without its advantages, many graces to which a freer movement of verse
would naturally have led.

May I not venture, then, to hope, that, instead of being a hindrance, by
anticipation of any part of the subject, these Sonnets may remind Mr.
Coleridge of his own more comprehensive design, and induce him to fulfil
it?--There is a sympathy in streams,--'one calleth to another;' and I
would gladly believe, that 'The Brook' will, ere long, murmur in concert
with 'The Duddon.' But, asking pardon for this fancy, I need not scruple
to say, that those verses must indeed be ill-fated which can enter upon
such pleasant walks of Nature, without receiving and giving inspiration.
The power of waters over the minds of Poets has been acknowledged from
the earliest ages;--through the 'Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius' of
Virgil, down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of the earth,
by Armstrong, and the simple ejaculation of Burns, (chosen, if I
recollect right, by Mr. Coleridge, as a motto for his embryo 'Brook,')--

    The Muse nae Poet ever fand her,
    Till by himsel' he learned to wander
    Adown some trotting burn's meander
    AND NA' THINK LANG.'


319. *_The Sonnets on the River Duddon_.

It is with the little River Duddon as it is with most other rivers,
Ganges and Nile not excepted,--many springs might claim the honour of
being its head. In my own fancy, I have fixed its rise near the noted
Shire Stones placed at the meeting point of the counties Westmoreland,
Cumberland, and Lancashire. They stand by the wayside, on the top of the
Wrynose Pass, and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say, that by
touching them at the same time with feet and hands, one had been in
three counties at once. At what point of its course the stream takes the
name of Duddon, I do not know. I first became acquainted with the
Duddon, as I have good reason to remember, in early boyhood. Upon the
banks of the Derwent, I had learnt to be very fond of angling. Fish
abound in that large river,--not so in the small streams in the
neighbourhood of Hawkshead; and I fell into the common delusion, that
the farther from home the better sport would be had. Accordingly, one
day I attached myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of
Hawkshead, who was going to try his fortune, as an angler, near the
source of the Duddon. We fished a great part of the day with very sorry
success, the rain pouring torrents; and long before we got home, I was
worn out with fatigue; and if the good man had not carried me on his
back, I must have lain down under the best shelter I could find. Little
did I think then it would have been my lot to celebrate, in a strain of
love and admiration, the stream which for many years I never thought of
without recollections of disappointment and distress.

During my college vacation, and two or three years afterwards, before
taking my bachelor's degree, I was several times resident in the house
of a near relative, who lived in the small town of Broughton. I passed
many delightful hours upon the banks of this river, which becomes an
estuary about a mile from that place. The remembrances of that period
are the subject of the 21st Sonnet. The subject of the 27th Sonnet is,
in fact, taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall, which once
stood, as is believed, upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as
you go from Rydal to Ambleside, and was deserted, from the superstitious
fear here described, and the present site fortunately chosen instead.
The present Hall was erected by Sir Michael le Fleming, and it may be
hoped that at some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of
so beautiful a position. With regard to the 30th Sonnet, it is odd
enough that this imagination was realised in the year 1840, when I made
a tour through this district with my wife and daughter, Miss Fenwick and
her niece, and Mr. and Miss Quillinan. Before our return from Seathwaite
Chapel, the party separated. Mrs. Wordsworth, while most of us went
further up the stream, chose an opposite direction, having told us that
we would overtake her on our way to Ulpha. But she was tempted out of
the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it, thinking it impossible
we should pass without seeing her. This however unfortunately happened;
and then ensued vexation and distress, especially to me, which I should
be ashamed to have recorded, for I lost my temper entirely. Neither I
nor those who were with me saw her again till we reached the Inn at
Broughton, seven miles. This may perhaps in some degree excuse my
irritability on the occasion, for I could not but think she had been
much to blame. It appeared, however, on explanation, that she had
remained on the rock, calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were
passing, in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which
had much charmed her. 'But on we went, her signals proving vain.' How
then could she reach Broughton before us? When we found she had not gone
on to Ulpha Kirk, Mr. Quillinan went back in one of the carriages in
search of her. He met her on the road, took her up, and by a shorter way
conveyed her to Broughton, where we were all re-united and spent a happy
evening.

I have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream. These I
forbear to mention, especially things that occurred on its banks during
the latter part of that visit to the sea-side, of which the former part
is detailed in my Epistle to Sir George Beaumont.

[The following additional notices of his latter excursion to the banks
of the Duddon are from a letter to Lady Frederick Bentinck.

'You will have wondered, dear Lady Frederick, what is become of me. I
have been wandering about the country, and only returned yesterday. Our
tour was by Keswick, Scale Hill, Buttermere, Loweswater, Ennerdale,
Calder Abbey, Wastdale, Eskdale, the Vale of Duddon, Broughton, Furness
Abbey, Peele Castle, Ulverston, &c.; we had broken weather, which kept
us long upon the road, but we had also very fine intervals, and I often
wished you had been present. We had such glorious sights! one, in
particular, I never saw the like of. About sunset we were directly
opposite that large, lofty precipice at Wastwater, which is called the
Screes. The ridge of it is broken into sundry points, and along them,
and partly along the side of the steep, went driving a procession of
yellow vapoury clouds from the sea-quarter towards the mountain
Scawfell. Their colours I have called yellow, but it was exquisitely
varied, and the shapes of the rocks on the summit of the ridge varied
with the density or thinness of the vapours. The effect was most
enchanting; for right above was steadfastly fixed a beautiful rainbow.
We were a party of seven, Mrs. Wordsworth, my daughter, and Miss Fenwick
included, and it would be difficult to say who was most delighted. The
Abbey of Furness, as you well know, is a noble ruin, and most happily
situated in a dell that entirely hides it from the surrounding country.
It is taken excellent care of, and seems little dilapidated since I
first knew it, more than half a century ago.][1]

320. _The Wild Strawberry: Sympson_. [Sonnet VI. ll. 9-10.]

    'There bloomed the strawberry of the wilderness,
    The trembling eyebright showed her sapphire blue.'

These two lines are in a great measure taken from 'The Beauties of
Spring, a Juvenile Poem,' by the Rev. Joseph Sympson. He was a native of
Cumberland, and was educated in the vale of Grasmere, and at Hawkshead
school: his poems are little known, but they contain passages of
splendid description; and the versification of his 'Vision of Alfred' is
harmonious and animated. In describing the motions of the Sylphs, that
constitute the strange machinery of his Poem, he uses the following
illustrative simile:

    --'Glancing from their plumes
    A changeful light the azure vault illumes.
    Less varying hues beneath the Pole adorn
    The streamy glories of the Boreal morn,
    That wavering to and fro their radiance shed
    On Bothnia's gulf with glassy ice o'erspread,
    Where the lone native, as he homeward glides,
    On polished sandals o'er the imprisoned tides,
    And still the balance of his frame preserves,
    Wheeled on alternate foot in lengthening curves,
    Sees at a glance, above him and below,
    Two rival heavens with equal splendour glow.
    Sphered in the centre of the world he seems;
    For all around with soft effulgence gleams;
    Stars, moons, and meteors, ray opposed to ray,
    And solemn midnight pours the blaze of day.'

He was a man of ardent feeling, and his faculties of mind, particularly
his memory, were extraordinary. Brief notices of his life ought to find
a place in the History of Westmoreland.


321. '_Return' and 'Seathwaite Chapel_.' [Sonnets XVII. and XVIII.]

The EAGLE requires a large domain for its support: but several pairs,
not many years ago, were constantly resident in this country, building
their nests in the steeps of Borrowdale, Wastdale, Ennerdale, and on the
eastern side of Helvellyn. Often have I heard anglers speak of the
grandeur of their appearance, as they hovered over Red Tarn, in one of
the coves of this mountain. The bird frequently returns, but is always
destroyed. Not long since, one visited Rydal lake, and remained some
hours near its banks: the consternation which it occasioned among the
different species of fowl, particularly the herons, was expressed by
loud screams. The horse also is naturally afraid of the eagle.--There
were several Roman stations among these mountains; the most considerable
seems to have been in a meadow at the head of Windermere, established,
undoubtedly, as a check over the Passes of Kirkstone, Dunmailraise, and
of Hardknot and Wrynose. On the margin of Rydal lake, a coin of Trajan
was discovered very lately.--The ROMAN FORT here alluded to, called by
the country people '_Hardknot Castle_,' is most impressively situated
half-way down the hill on the right of the road that descends from
Hardknot into Eskdale. It has escaped the notice of most antiquarians,
and is but slightly mentioned by Lysons.--The DRUIDICAL CIRCLE is about
half a mile to the left of the road ascending Stone-side from the vale
of Duddon: the country people call it '_Sunken Church_.'

The reader who may have been interested in the foregoing Sonnets, (which
together may be considered as a Poem,) will not be displeased to find in
this place a prose account of the Duddon, extracted from Green's
comprehensive _Guide to the Lakes_, lately published. 'The road leading
from Coniston to Broughton is over high ground, and commands a view of
the River Duddon; which, at high water, is a grand sight, having the
beautiful and fertile lands of Lancashire and Cumberland stretching each
way from its margin. In this extensive view, the face of Nature is
displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and dale; wooded grounds and
buildings; amongst the latter Broughton Tower, seated on the crown of a
hill, rising elegantly from the valley, is an object of extraordinary
interest. Fertility on each side is gradually diminished, and lost in
the superior heights of Blackcomb, in Cumberland, and the high lands
between Kirkby and Ulverstone.

'The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks of the Duddon,
and on its Lancashire side it is of various elevations. The river is an
amusing companion, one while brawling and tumbling over rocky
precipices, until the agitated water becomes again calm by arriving at a
smoother and less precipitous bed, but its course is soon again ruffled,
and the current thrown into every variety of form which the rocky
channel of a river can give to water.'--_Vide Green's Guide to the
Lakes_, vol. i. pp. 98-100.

After all, the traveller would be most gratified who should approach
this beautiful Stream, neither at its source, as is done in the Sonnets,
nor from its termination; but from Coniston over Walna Scar; first
descending into a little circular valley, a collateral compartment of
the long winding vale through which flows the Duddon. This recess,
towards the close of September, when the after-grass of the meadow is
still of a fresh green, with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but
perhaps none fallen, is truly enchanting. At a point elevated enough to
show the various objects in the valley, and not so high as to diminish
their importance, the stranger will instinctively halt. On the
foreground, a little below the most favourable station, a rude
foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook foaming by the
wayside. Russet and craggy hills, of bold and varied outline, surround
the level valley, which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch
trees. A few homesteads are interspersed, in some places peeping out
from among the rocks like hermitages, whose site has been chosen for the
benefit of sunshine as well as shelter; in other instances, the
dwelling-house, barn, and byre compose together a cruciform structure,
which, with its embowering trees, and the ivy clothing part of the walls
and roof like a fleece, call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey.
Time, in most cases, and Nature everywhere, have given a sanctity to the
humble works of man that are scattered over this peaceful retirement.
Hence a harmony of tone and colour, a consummation and perfection of
beauty, which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered with
the course of convenience, utility, or necessity. This unvitiated region
stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its
features. As it glistens in the morning sunshine, it would fill the
spectator's heart with gladsomeness. Looking from our chosen station, he
would feel an impatience to rove among its pathways, to be greeted by
the milkmaid, to wander from house to house, exchanging 'good-morrows'
as he passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the sun is set, and a
pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky, with an
answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows; when the trees
are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable; when the cool air has
condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage chimneys; when the dark
mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming brook; _then_, he
would be unwilling to move forward, not less from a reluctance to
relinquish what he beholds, than from an apprehension of disturbing, by
his approach, the quietness beneath him. Issuing from the plain of this
valley, the brook descends in a rapid torrent passing by the churchyard
of Seathwaite. The traveller is thus conducted at once into the midst of
the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to the Sonnets from
the 14th to the 20th inclusive. From the point where the Seathwaite
brook joins the Duddon, is a view upwards, into the pass through which
the river makes its way into the plain of Donnerdale. The perpendicular
rock on the right bears the ancient British name of THE PEN; the one
opposite is called WALLA-BARROW CRAG, a name that occurs in other places
to designate rocks of the same character. The _chaotic_ aspect of the
scene is well marked by the expression of a stranger, who strolled out
while dinner was preparing, and at his return, being asked by his
host, 'What way he had been wandering?' replied, 'As far as it is
_finished_!'

The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments of rocks
fallen from aloft; which, as Mr. Green truly says, 'are happily adapted
to the many-shaped waterfalls,' (or rather water-breaks, for none of
them are high,) 'displayed in the short space of half a mile.' That
there is some hazard in frequenting these desolate places, I myself have
had proof; for one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot
where, with a friend, I had lingered the day before. 'The concussion,'
says Mr. Green, speaking of the event, (for he also, in the practice of
his art, on that day sat exposed for a still longer time to the same
peril,) 'was heard, not without alarm, by the neighbouring shepherds.'
But to return to Seathwaite Churchyard: it contains the following
inscription:

     In memory of the Reverend Robert Walker, who died the 25th of June,
     1802, in the 93d year of his age, and 67th of his curacy at
     Seathwaite.

     'Also, of Anne his wife, who died the 28th of January, in the 93d
     year of her age.'

In the parish-register of Seathwaite Chapel, is this notice:

     'Buried, June 28th, the Rev. Robert Walker. He was curate of
     Seathwaite sixty-six years. He was a man singular for his
     temperance, industry, and integrity.'

This individual is the Pastor alluded to, in the eighteenth Sonnet, as a
worthy compeer of the country parson of Chaucer, &c. In the seventh book
of the _Excursion_, an abstract of his character is given, beginning--

    'A Priest abides before whose life such doubts
    Fall to the ground;--'

and some account of his life, for it is worthy of being recorded, will
not be out of place here.


322. _Memoir of the Rev. Robert Walker_.

('Pastor,' in Book vii. of 'The Excursion.')

In the year 1709, Robert Walker was born at Under-crag, in Seathwaite;
he was the youngest of twelve children. His eldest brother, who
inherited the small family estate, died at Under-crag, aged ninety-four,
being twenty-four years older than the subject of this Memoir, who was
born of the same mother. Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his
boyhood and youth, continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health,
it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to _breed him a
scholar_; for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a
livelihood by bodily labour. At that period few of these dales were
furnished with schoolhouses; the children being taught to read and write
in the chapel; and in the same consecrated building, where he officiated
for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster, he himself received
the rudiments of his education. In his youth he became schoolmaster at
Loweswater; not being called upon, probably, in that situation, to teach
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. But, by the assistance of a
'Gentleman' in the neighbourhood, he acquired, at leisure hours, a
knowledge of the classics, and became qualified for taking holy orders.
Upon his ordination, he had the offer of two curacies: the one, Torver,
in the vale of Coniston,--the other, Seathwaite, in his native vale. The
value of each was the same, _viz_., five pounds _per annum_: but the
cure of Seathwaite having a cottage attached to it, as he wished to
marry, he chose it in preference. The young person on whom his
affections were fixed, though in the condition of a domestic servant,
had given promise, by her serious and modest deportment, and by her
virtuous dispositions, that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a
man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself.
By her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money, with which they
began house-keeping. In 1735 or 1736, he entered upon his curacy; and,
nineteen years afterwards, his situation is thus described, in some
letters to be found in the _Annual Register_ for 1760, from which the
following is extracted:--

            'To MR. ----.
                                    'Coniston, July 26, 1754.

'Sir,--I was the other day upon a party of pleasure, about five or six
miles from this place, where I met with a very striking object, and of a
nature not very common. Going into a clergyman's house (of whom I had
frequently heard), I found him sitting at the head of a long square
table, such as is commonly used in this country by the lower class of
people, dressed in a coarse blue frock, trimmed with black horn buttons;
a checked shirt, a leathern strap about his neck for a stock, a coarse
apron, and a pair of great wooden-soled shoes plated with iron to
preserve them (what we call clogs in these parts), with a child upon his
knee, eating his breakfast; his wife, and the remainder of his children,
were some of them employed in waiting upon each other, the rest in
teasing and spinning wool, at which trade he is a great proficient; and
moreover, when it is made ready for sale, will lay it, by sixteen or
thirty-two pounds' weight, upon his back, and on foot, seven or eight
miles, will carry it to the market, even in the depth of winter. I was
not much surprised at all this, as you may possibly be, having heard a
great deal of it related before. But I must confess myself astonished
with the alacrity and the good humour that appeared both in the
clergyman and his wife, and more so at the sense and ingenuity of the
clergyman himself...'

Then follows a letter from another person, dated 1755, from which an
extract shall be given.

'By his frugality and good management, he keeps the wolf from the door,
as we say; and if he advances a little in the world, it is owing more to
his own care, than to anything else he has to rely upon. I don't find
his inclination is running after further preferment. He is settled among
the people, that are happy among themselves; and lives in the greatest
unanimity and friendship with them; and, I believe, the minister and
people are exceedingly satisfied with each other; and indeed how should
they be dissatisfied when they have a person of so much worth and
probity for their pastor? A man who, for his candour and meekness, his
sober, chaste, and virtuous conversation, his soundness in principle and
practice, is an ornament to his profession, and an honour to the country
he is in; and bear with me if I say, the plainness of his dress, the
sanctity of his manners, the simplicity of his doctrine, and the
vehemence of his expression, have a sort of resemblance to the pure
practice of primitive Christianity.'

We will now give his own account of himself, to be found in the same
place.


'FROM THE REV. ROBERT WALKER.

'Sir,--Yours of the 26th instant was communicated to me by Mr. C----,
and I should have returned an immediate answer, but the hand of
Providence, then laying heavy upon an amiable pledge of conjugal
endearment, hath since taken from me a promising girl, which the
disconsolate mother too pensively laments the loss of; though we have
yet eight living, all healthful, hopeful children, whose names and ages
are as follows:--Zaccheus, aged almost eighteen years; Elizabeth,
sixteen years and ten months; Mary, fifteen; Moses, thirteen years and
three months; Sarah, ten years and three months; Mabel, eight years and
three months; William Tyson, three years and eight months; and Anne
Esther, one year and three months; besides Anne, who died two years and
six months ago, and was then aged between nine and ten; and Eleanor, who
died the 23d inst., January, aged six years and ten months. Zaccheus,
the eldest child, is now learning the trade of tanner, and has two years
and a half of his apprenticeship to serve. The annual income of my
chapel at present, as near as I can compute it, may amount to about
17_l._, of which is paid in cash, viz., 5_l._ from the bounty of Queen
Anne, and 5_l._ from W.P., Esq., of P----, out of the annual rents, he
being lord of the manor; and 3_l._ from the several inhabitants of
L----, settled upon the tenements as a rent-charge; the house and
gardens I value at 4_l._ yearly, and not worth more; and I believe the
surplice fees and voluntary contributions, one year with another, may be
worth 3_l._; but as the inhabitants are few in number, and the fees very
low, this last-mentioned sum consists merely in free-will offerings.

'I am situated greatly to my satisfaction with regard to the conduct and
behaviour of my auditory, who not only live in the happy ignorance of
the follies and vices of the age, but in mutual peace and good-will with
one another, and are seemingly (I hope really too) sincere Christians,
and sound members of the Established Church, not one dissenter of any
denomination being amongst them all. I got to the value of 40_l._ for my
wife's fortune, but had no real estate of my own, being the youngest son
of twelve children, born of obscure parents; and, though my income has
been but small, and my family large, yet, by a providential blessing
upon my own diligent endeavours, the kindness of friends, and a cheap
country to live in, we have always had the necessaries of life. By what
I have written (which is a true and exact account, to the best of my
knowledge,) I hope you will not think your favour to me, out of the late
worthy Dr. Stratford's effects, quite misbestowed, for which I must ever
gratefully own myself,

Sir,
'Your much obliged and most obedient humble Servant,
                       'R.W., Curate of S----.

'To Mr. C., of Lancaster.'

About the time when this letter was written the Bishop of Chester
recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of Ulpha to the contiguous
one of Seathwaite, and the nomination was offered to Mr. Walker; but an
unexpected difficulty arising, Mr. W., in a letter to the Bishop, (a
copy of which, in his own beautiful handwriting, now lies before me,)
thus expresses himself. 'If he,' meaning the person in whom the
difficulty originated, 'had suggested any such objection before, I
should utterly have declined any attempt to the curacy of Ulpha;
indeed, I was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable to my
auditory at Seathwaite, as they have been always accustomed to double
duty, and the inhabitants of Ulpha despair of being able to support a
schoolmaster who is not curate there also; which suppressed all thoughts
in me of serving them both.' And in a second letter to the Bishop he
writes:

'My Lord,--I have the favour of yours of the 1st instant, and am
exceedingly obliged on account of the Ulpha affair: if that curacy
should lapse into your Lordship's hands, I would beg leave rather to
decline than embrace it; for the chapels of Seathwaite and Ulpha,
annexed together, would be apt to cause a general discontent among the
inhabitants of both places; by either thinking themselves slighted,
being only served alternately, or neglected in the duty, or attributing
it to covetousness in me; all which occasions of murmuring I would
willingly avoid.' And in concluding his former letter, he expresses a
similar sentiment upon the same occasion, 'desiring, if it be possible,
however, as much as in me lieth, to live peaceably with all men.'

       *       *       *       *       *

The year following, the curacy of Seathwaite was again augmented; and,
to effect this augmentation, fifty pounds had been advanced by himself;
and, in 1760, lands were purchased with eight hundred pounds. Scanty as
was his income, the frequent offer of much better benefices could not
tempt Mr. W. to quit a situation where he had been so long happy, with a
consciousness of being useful. Among his papers I find the following
copy of a letter, dated 1775, twenty years after his refusal of the
curacy of Ulpha, which will show what exertions had been made for one of
his sons.


'May it please your Grace,--Our remote situation here makes it difficult
to get the necessary information for transacting business regularly;
such is the reason of my giving your Grace the present trouble.

'The bearer (my son) is desirous of offering himself candidate for
deacon's orders at your Grace's ensuing ordination; the first, on the
25th instant, so that his papers could not be transmitted in due time.
As he is now fully at age, and I have afforded him education to the
utmost of my ability, it would give me great satisfaction (if your
Grace would take him, and find him qualified) to have him ordained. His
constitution has been tender for some years; he entered the college of
Dublin, but his health would not permit him to continue there, or I
would have supported him much longer. He has been with me at home above
a year, in which time he has gained great strength of body, sufficient,
I hope, to enable him for performing the function. Divine Providence,
assisted by liberal benefactors, has blest my endeavours, from a small
income, to rear a numerous family; and as my time of life renders me now
unfit for much future expectancy from this world, I should be glad to
see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an honest livelihood
for himself. His behaviour, so far in life, has been irreproachable; and
I hope he will not degenerate, in principles or practice, from the
precepts and pattern of an indulgent parent. Your Grace's favourable
reception of this, from a distant corner of the diocese, and an obscure
hand, will excite filial gratitude, and a due use shall be made of the
obligation vouchsafed thereby to

'Your Grace's very dutiful and most obedient Son and Servant, ROBERT
WALKER.'


The same man, who was thus liberal in the education of his numerous
family, was even munificent in hospitality as a parish priest. Every
Sunday, were served, upon the long table, at which he has been described
sitting with a child upon his knee, messes of broth, for the refreshment
of those of his congregation who came from a distance, and usually took
their seats as parts of his own household. It seems scarcely possible
that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his
cure; and what would to many have been a high price of self-denial, was
paid, by the pastor and his family, for this gratification; as the treat
could only be provided by dressing at one time the whole, perhaps, of
their weekly allowance of fresh animal food; consequently, for a
succession of days, the table was covered with cold victuals only. His
generosity in old age may be still further illustrated by a little
circumstance relating to an orphan grandson, then ten years of age,
which I find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons; he requests that
half a guinea may be left for 'little Robert's pocket-money,' who was
then at school: intrusting it to the care of a lady, who, as he says,
'may sometimes frustrate his squandering it away foolishly,' and
promising to send him an equal allowance annually for the same purpose.
The conclusion of the same letter is so characteristic, that I cannot
forbear to transcribe it. 'We,' meaning his wife and himself, 'are in
our wonted state of health, allowing for the hasty strides of old age
knocking daily at our door, and threateningly telling us, we are not
only mortal, but must expect ere long to take our leave of our ancient
cottage, and lie down in our last dormitory. Pray pardon my neglect to
answer yours: let us hear sooner from you, to augment the mirth of the
Christmas holidays. Wishing you all the pleasures of the approaching
season, I am, dear Son, with lasting sincerity, yours affectionately,

'ROBERT WALKER.'


He loved old customs and old usages, and in some instances stuck to them
to his own loss; for, having had a sum of money lodged in the hands of a
neighbouring tradesman, when long course of time had raised the rate of
interest, and more was offered, he refused to accept it; an act not
difficult to one, who, while he was drawing seventeen pounds a year from
his curacy, declined, as we have seen, to add the profits of another
small benefice to his own, lest he should be suspected of
cupidity.--From this vice he was utterly free; he made no charge for
teaching school; such as could afford to pay, gave him what they
pleased. When very young, having kept a diary of his expenses, however
trifling, the large amount, at the end of the year, surprised him; and
from that time the rule of his life was to be economical, not
avaricious. At his decease he left behind him no less a sum than
2000_l._; and such a sense of his various excellencies was prevalent in
the country, that the epithet of WONDERFUL is to this day attached to
his name.

There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require
further _explanatory_ details.--And to begin with his industry; eight
hours in each day, during five days in the week, and half of Saturday,
except when the labours of husbandry were urgent, he was occupied in
teaching. His seat was within the rails of the altar; the communion
table was his desk; and, like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master
employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were
repeating their lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours,
if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour,
exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel, at which he
had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping
to and fro. Thus, was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the
waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when
occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management
of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as
scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants,
&c., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his
employers. These labours (at all times considerable) at one period of
the year, viz., between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions
are settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed great
part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his desk. His garden
also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the
mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his
attendance; with this pastoral occupation, he joined the labours of
husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to
his own less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the
cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.

He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing their flocks,
and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently
dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a
haycock, or a fleece; less as a recompence for this particular service
than as a general acknowledgment. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept
holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and
family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also
duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every
week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind;
not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon,
when he indulged himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine.
The frugality and temperance established in his house, were as admirable
as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was
there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been
brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for
such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had
been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his
wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and
decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials were made
up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of the decease of this
thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen
and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning. And it is
remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit,
remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands.
It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no
other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of
modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours,
consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The
lights by which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were
of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these
cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes, dipped in any unctuous
substance that the house affords. _White_ candles, as tallow candles are
here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were
perhaps produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during the
proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and
killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the
year, was salted and dried for winter provision: the hide was tanned to
furnish them with shoes.--By these various resources, this venerable
clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he
affectingly says, 'from wanting the necessaries of life;' but affording
them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in
society. In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their
father's example, his precepts, and injunctions: he was aware that
truth-speaking, as a moral virtue, is best secured by inculcating
attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions; and so rigid
were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his
family, that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields
anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to
whom it belonged, he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back
to the place from which it had been brought.

No one it might be thought could, as has been described, convert his
body into a machine, as it were, of industry for the humblest uses, and
keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon secular concerns, without
grievous injury to the more precious parts of his nature. How could the
powers of intellect thrive, or its graces be displayed, in the midst of
circumstances apparently so unfavourable, and where, to the direct
cultivation of the mind, so small a portion of time was allotted? But,
in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were
reconciled. His conversation was remarkable, not only for being chaste
and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent; his
written style was correct, simple, and animated. Nor did his
_affections_ suffer more than his intellect; he was tenderly alive to
all the duties of his pastoral office: the poor and needy 'he never sent
empty away,'--the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that
unfrequented vale--the sick were visited; and the feelings of humanity
found further exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the
worldly estate of his neighbours, with which his talents for business
made him acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and
uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs
confided to him, were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience
from religious obligation. Nor could such conduct fail to remind those
who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom: they felt
convictions which, but for such intercourse, could not have been
afforded, that, as in the practice of their pastor, there was no guile,
so in his faith there was nothing hollow; and we are warranted in
believing, that upon these occasions, selfishness, obstinacy, and
discord would often give way before the breathings of his good-will, and
saintly integrity. It may be presumed also--while his humble
congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered
from the pulpit, and to the Christian exhortations that they should love
their neighbours as themselves, and do as they would be done unto--that
peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher's labours by recollections
in the minds of his congregation, that they were called upon to do no
more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes.

The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than
that of the morning, but by a more serious auditory; the lesson from the
New Testament, on those occasions, was accompanied by Burkitt's
Commentaries. These lessons he read with impassioned emphasis,
frequently drawing tears from his hearers, and leaving a lasting
impression upon their minds. His devotional feelings and the powers of
his own mind were further exercised, along with those of his family, in
perusing the Scriptures; not only on the Sunday evenings, but on every
other evening, while the rest of the household were at work, some one of
the children, and in her turn the servant, for the sake of practice in
reading, or for instruction, read the Bible aloud; and in this manner
the whole was repeatedly gone through. That no common importance was
attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family,
appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants, which I
am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic, and somewhat
curious. 'There is a small chapel in the county palatine of Lancaster,
where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years,
and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in
the same, to a decent number of devout communicants. After the clergyman
had received himself, the first company out of the assembly who
approached the altar, and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred
elements, consisted of the parson's wife; to whom he had been married
upwards of sixty years; one son and his wife; four daughters, each with
her husband; whose ages, all added together, amount to above 714 years.
The several and respective distances from the place of each of their
abodes, to the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more
than 1000 English miles. Though the narration will appear surprising, it
is without doubt a fact that the same persons, exactly four years
before, met at the same place, and all joined in performance of the same
venerable duty.'

He was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the
Established Church. We have seen him congratulating himself that he had
no dissenters in his cure of any denomination. Some allowance must be
made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were
received, before the reader will acquit him of bigotry, when I mention,
that at the time of the augmentation of the cure, he refused to invest
part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon
advantageous terms, because the proprietor was a Quaker;--whether from
scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract
framed for the benefit of the Church between persons not in religious
sympathy with each other; or, as a seeker of peace, he was afraid of the
uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous
in that sect. Of this an instance had fallen under his own notice; for,
while he taught school at Loweswater, certain persons of that
denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of
Church-stock;[2] a great hardship upon the incumbent, for the curacy of
Loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of Seathwaite. To what
degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be
determined;--certain it is, that he was not only desirous, as he himself
says, to live in peace, but in love, with all men. He was placable, and
charitable in his judgments; and, however correct in conduct and
rigorous to himself, he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of
others, and to soften the censure that was cast upon their
frailties.--It would be unpardonable to omit that, in the maintenance of
his virtues, he received due support from the partner of his long life.
She was equally strict, in attending to her share of their joint cares,
nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations. A person who had been
some time their servant in the latter part of their lives, concluded the
panegyric of her mistress by saying to me, 'She was no less excellent
than her husband; she was good to the poor; she was good to every
thing!' He survived for a short time this virtuous companion. When she
died, he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of
her daughters and one grand-daughter; and, when the corpse was lifted
from the threshold, he insisted upon lending his aid, and feeling about,
for he was then almost blind, took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin;
and, as a bearer of the body, entered the chapel, a few steps from the
lowly parsonage.

[2] Mr. Walker's charity being of that kind which 'seeketh not her own,'
he would rather forego his rights than distrain for dues which the
parties liable refused, as a point of conscience, to pay.

What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated, and, in point of
worldly wealth, poorly-repaid Churchman, present to that of a Cardinal
Wolsey!

    'O 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen
    Too heavy for a man who hopes for heaven!'

We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world, that have
brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground, in which
this venerable pair lie interred. The sounding brook, that rolls close
by the churchyard, without disturbing feeling or meditation, is now
unfortunately laid bare; but not long ago it participated, with the
chapel, the shade of some stately ash-trees, which will not spring
again. While the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the
girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale,--masses of rock,
out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been
hewn--it would surprise him to be told, as with truth he might be, that
the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a
production of a quarry in North Wales. It was sent as a mark of respect
by one of their descendants from the vale of Festiniog, a region almost
as beautiful as that in which it now lies!

Upon the Seathwaite Brook, at a small distance from the parsonage, has
been erected a mill for spinning yarn; it is a mean and disagreeable
object, though not unimportant to the spectator, as calling to mind the
momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of
society--changes which have proved especially unfavourable to these
mountain solitudes. So much had been effected by those new powers,
before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life,
that their operation could not escape his notice, and doubtless excited
touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his
own manual industry. But Robert Walker was not a man of times and
circumstances; had he lived at a later period, the principle of duty
would have produced application as unremitting; the same energy of
character would have been displayed, though in many instances with
widely different effects.

With pleasure I annex, as illustrative and confirmatory of the above
account, extracts from a paper in the _Christian Remembrancer_, October,
1819: it bears an assumed signature, but is known to be the work of the
Rev. Bobert Bamford, vicar of Bishopton, in the county of Durham; a
great-grandson of Mr. Walker, whose worth it commemorates, by a record
not the less valuable for being written in very early youth.

'His house was a nursery of virtue. All the inmates were industrious,
and cleanly, and happy. Sobriety, neatness, quietness, characterised the
whole family. No railings, no idleness, no indulgence of passion, were
permitted. Every child, ever young, had its appointed engagements;
every hand was busy. Knitting, spinning, reading, writing, mending
clothes, making shoes, were by the different children constantly
performing. The father himself sitting amongst them, and guiding their
thoughts, was engaged in the same occupations....

'He sate up late, and rose early; when the family were at rest, he
retired to a little room which he had built on the roof of his house. He
had slated it, and fitted it up with shelves for his books, his stock of
cloth, wearing apparel, and his utensils. There many a cold winter's
night, without fire, while the roof was glazed with ice, did he remain
reading or writing till the day dawned. He taught the children in the
chapel, for there was no schoolhouse. Yet in that cold, damp place he
never had a fire. He used to send the children in parties either to his
own fire at home, or make them run up the mountain side.

       *       *       *       *       *

'It may be further mentioned, that he was a passionate admirer of
Nature; she was his mother, and he was a dutiful child. While engaged on
the mountains it was his greatest pleasure to view the rising sun; and
in tranquil evenings, as it slided behind the hills, he blessed its
departure. He was skilled in fossils and plants; a constant observer of
the stars and winds: the atmosphere was his delight. He made many
experiments on its nature and properties. In summer he used to gather a
multitude of flies and insects, and, by his entertaining description,
amuse and instruct his children. They shared all his daily employments,
and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence from his
observations on the works and productions of Nature. Whether they were
following him in the field, or surrounding him in school, he took every
opportunity of storing their minds with useful information.--Nor was the
circle of his influence confined to Seathwaite. Many a distant mother
has told her child of Mr. Walker, and begged him to be as good a man.

       *       *       *       *       *

'Once, when I was very young, I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing
that venerable old man in his 90th year, and even then, the calmness,
the force, the perspicuity of his sermon, sanctified and adorned by the
wisdom of grey hairs, and the authority of virtue, had such an effect
upon my mind, that I never see a hoary-headed clergyman, without
thinking of Mr. Walker.... He allowed no dissenter or methodist to
interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure: and so
successful were his exertions, that he had not one dissenter of any
denomination whatever in the whole parish.--Though he avoided all
religious controversies, yet when age had silvered his head, and
virtuous piety had secured to his appearance reverence and silent
honour, no one, however determined in his hatred of apostolic descent,
could have listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and
ancient times, without thinking, that one of the beloved apostles had
returned to mortality, and in that vale of peace had come to exemplify
the beauty of holiness in the life and character of Mr. Walker.

       *       *       *       *       *

'Until the sickness of his wife, a few months previous to her death, his
health and spirits and faculties were unimpaired. But this misfortune
gave him such a shock, that his constitution gradually decayed. His
senses, except sight, still preserved their powers. He never preached
with steadiness after his wife's death. His voice faltered: he always
looked at the seat she had used. He could not pass her tomb without
tears. He became, when alone, sad and melancholy, though still among his
friends kind and good-humoured. He went to bed about twelve o'clock the
night before his death. As his custom was, he went, tottering and
leaning upon his daughter's arm, to examine the heavens, and meditate a
few moments in the open air. "How clear the moon shines to-night!" He
said these words, sighed, and laid down. At six next morning he was
found a corpse. Many a tear, and many a heavy heart, and many a grateful
blessing followed him to the grave.'

Having mentioned in this narrative the vale of Loweswater as a place
where Mr. Walker taught school, I will add a few memoranda from its
parish register, respecting a person apparently of desires as moderate,
with whom he must have been intimate during his residence there.

    'Let him that would, ascend the tottering seat
    Of courtly grandeur, and become as great
    As are his mounting wishes; but for me,
    Let sweet repose and rest my portion be.

    HENRY FOREST, Curate,'

    'Honour, the idol which the most adore,
    Receives no homage from my knee;
    Content in privacy I value more
    Than all uneasy dignity.'

     'Henry Forest came to Loweswater, 1708, being 25 years of age.'

     'This curacy was twice augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty. The first
     payment, with great difficulty, was paid to Mr. John Curwen of
     London, on the 9th of May, 1724, deposited by me, Henry Forest,
     Curate of Loweswater. Ye said 9th of May, ye said Mr. Curwen went
     to the office, and saw my name registered there, &c. This, by the
     Providence of God, came by lot to this poor place.

     Haec testor H. Forest.'

In another place he records, that the sycamore trees were planted in the
churchyard in 1710.

He died in 1741, having been curate thirty-four years. It is not
improbable that H. Forest was the gentleman who assisted Robert Walker
in his classical studies at Loweswater.

To this parish register is prefixed a motto, of which the following
verses are a part:

    'Invigilate viri, tacito nam tempora gressu
    Diffugiunt, nulloque sono convertitur annus;
    Utendum est aetate, cito pede praeterit ajtas.'


323. _Milton_.

    'We feel that we are greater than we know.' [Sonnet XXXIV. l. 14.]
    'And feel that I am happier than I know.' MILTON.

The allusion to the Greek Poet will be obvious to the classical reader.


324. _The White Doe of Rylstone; or the Fate of the Nortons_.

ADVERTISEMENT.

During the summer of 1807 I visited, for the first time, the beautiful
country that surrounds Bolton Priory, in Yorkshire; and the Poem of the
White Doe, founded upon a tradition connected with that place, was
composed at the close of the same year.

THE WHITE DOE OF RYLSTONE.

The Poem of the White Doe of Rylstone is founded on a local tradition,
and on the Ballad in Percy's Collection, entitled, 'The Rising of the
North.' The tradition is as follows: 'About this time,' not long after
the Dissolution, 'a White Doe,' say the aged people of the
neighbourhood, 'long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from
Rylstone over the falls of Bolton, and was constantly found in the Abbey
Churchyard during divine service; after the close of which she returned
home as regularly as the rest of the congregation.'--Dr. Whitaker's
_History of the Deanery of Craven_.--Rylstone was the property and
residence of the Nortons, distinguished in that ill-advised and
unfortunate Insurrection; which led me to connect with this tradition
the principal circumstances of their fate, as recorded in the Ballad.

'Bolton Priory,' says Dr. Whitaker in his excellent book, _The History
and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven_, 'stands upon a beautiful
curvature of the Wharf, on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it
from inundations, and low enough for every purpose of picturesque
effect.

'Opposite to the east window of the Priory Church the river washes the
foot of a rock nearly perpendicular, and of the richest purple, where
several of the mineral beds, which break out, instead of maintaining
their usual inclination to the horizon, are twisted by some
inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines. To the south all
is soft and delicious; the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures, a
moderate reach of the river, sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to
the sun, and the bounding hills beyond, neither too near nor too lofty
to exclude, even in winter, any portion of his rays.

'But, after all, the glories of Bolton are on the north. Whatever the
most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape,
is not only found here, but in its proper place. In front, and
immediately under the eye, is a smooth expanse of park-like enclosure,
spotted with native elm, ash, &c. of the finest growth: on the right a
skirting oak wood, with jutting points of grey rock; on the left a
rising copse. Still forward are seen the aged groves of Bolton Park, the
growth of centuries; and farther yet, the barren and rocky distances of
Simonseat and Barden Fell contrasted with the warmth, fertility, and
luxuriant foliage of the valley below.

'About half a mile above Bolton the valley closes, and either side of
the Wharf is overhung by solemn woods, from which huge perpendicular
masses of grey rock jut out at intervals.

'This sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late, that
ridings have been cut on both sides of the river, and the most
interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods. Here a
tributary stream rushes from a waterfall, and bursts through a woody
glen to mingle its waters with the Wharf: there the Wharf itself is
nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock, and next becomes a horned flood
enclosing a woody island--sometimes it reposes for a moment, and then
resumes its native character, lively, irregular, and impetuous.

'The cleft mentioned above is the tremendous STRID. This chasm, being
incapable of receiving the winter floods, has formed on either side a
broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock-basins, or "pots of the
Linn," which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many
Northern torrents. But, if here Wharf is lost to the eye, it amply
repays another sense by its deep and solemn roar, like "the Voice of the
angry Spirit of the Waters," heard far above and beneath, amidst the
silence of the surrounding woods.

'The terminating object of the landscape is the remains of Barden Tower,
interesting from their form and situation, and still more so from the
recollections which they excite.'


325. *_The White Doe of Rylstone_.

The earlier half of this poem was composed at Stockton-upon-Tees, when
Mary and I were on a visit to her eldest brother, Mr. Hutchinson, at the
close of the year 1807. The country is flat, and the weather was rough.
I was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row
of stacks, in a field at a small distance from the town, and there
poured forth my verses aloud, as freely as they would come. Mary reminds
me that her brother stood upon the punctilio of not sitting down to
dinner till I joined the party; and it frequently happened that I did
not make my appearance till too late, so that she was made
uncomfortable. I here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions
during the whole course of our wedded life. To my beloved sister the
same apology is due.

When, from the visit just mentioned, we returned to Town-End, Grasmere,
I proceeded with the poem. It may be worth while to note as a caution to
others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda, that the skin having
been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe, though I
desisted from walking, I found that the irritation of the wounded part
was kept up by the act of composition, to a degree that made it
necessary to give my constitution a holiday. A rapid cure was the
consequence.

Poetic excitement, when accompanied by protracted labour in composition,
has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement.
Nevertheless I am, at the close of my seventy-third year, in what may be
called excellent health. So that intellectual labour is not,
necessarily, unfavourable to longevity. But perhaps I ought here to add,
that mine has been generally carried on out of doors.

Let me here say a few words of this Poem, by way of criticism. The
subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to
some of Walter Scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of
society. The comparison is inconsiderate. Sir Walter pursued the
customary and very natural course of conducting an action, presenting
various turns of fortune, to some outstanding point on which the mind
might rest as a termination or catastrophe. The course I attempted to
pursue is entirely different. Everything that is attempted by the
principal personages in the 'White Doe' fails, so far as its object is
external and substantial: so far as it is moral and spiritual, it
succeeds. The heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to
interfere with the current of events, either to forward or delay them;
but--

          'To abide
    The shock, and finally secure
    O'er pain and grief a triumph pure.'

This she does in obedience to her brother's injunction, as most suitable
to a mind and character that, under previous trials, had been proved to
accord with his. She achieves this, not without aid from the
communication with the inferior creature, which often leads her thoughts
to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that
exalts rather than depresses her. The anticipated beatification, if I
may so say, of her mind, and the apotheosis of the companion of her
solitude, are the points at which the poem aims, and constitute its
legitimate catastrophe; far too spiritual a one for instant or
widely-spread sympathy, but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep
and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel
more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things, and
interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social
forms of life than to its internal spirit.

How insignificant a thing, for example, does personal prowess appear,
compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom; in other
words, with struggles for the sake of principle, in preference to
victory gloried in for its own sake!

[To these remarks may be added the following, in a letter from the
writer to his friend Archdeacon Wrangham:

                     'Thanksgiving Day, Jan. 1816.
                                     Rydal Mount.

'MY DEAR WRANGHAM,

'You have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition, and
those affectionate feelings which I have long known you to possess, by
writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence.

       *       *       *       *       *

'Of the "White Doe" I have little to say, but that I hope it will be
acceptable to the intelligent, for whom alone it is written. It starts
from a high point of imagination, and comes round, through various
wanderings of that faculty, to a still higher--nothing less than the
apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the
poem. And as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty
imagination, every motive and impetus that actuates the persons
introduced is from the same source; a kindred spirit pervades, and is
intended to harmonise the whole. Throughout, objects (the banner, for
instance) derive their influence, not from properties inherent in them,
not from what they _are_ actually in themselves, but from such as are
_bestowed_ upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or
affected by those objects. Thus the poetry, if there be any in the work,
proceeds, as it ought to do, from the _soul of man_, communicating its
creative energies to the images of the external world. But, too much of
this.

                           'Most faithfully yours,
                               'W. WORDSWORTH.'][3]

This and the five lines that follow were either read or recited by me,
more than thirty years since, to the late Mr. Hazlitt, who quoted some
expressions in them (imperfectly remembered) in a work of his published
several years ago.

327. _Bolton Alley_.

     'From Bolton's old monastic Tower' (c. i. l. 1).

It is to be regretted that at the present day Bolton Abbey wants this
ornament; but the Poem, according to the imagination of the Poet, is
composed in Queen Elizabeth's time. 'Formerly,' says Dr. Whitaker, 'over
the Transept was a tower. This is proved not only from the mention of
bells at the Dissolution, when they could have had no other place, but
from the pointed roof of the choir, which must have terminated westward,
in some building of superior height to the ridge.'

The detail of this tradition may be found in Dr. Whitaker's book, and in

See the Old Ballad--'The Rising of the North.'

denominated the Battle of the Standard.


330. _Bells of Rylstone_ (c. vii. l. 212).

    'When the Bells of Rylstone played
    Their Sabbath music--"God us ayde!"'

On one of the bells of Rylstone church, which seems coeval with the
building of the tower, is this cypher, 'I.N.,' for John Norton, and the
motto, 'God us Ayde.'


331. '_The grassy rock-encircled Pound_' (c. vii. l. 253).

After a quotation from Whitaker. I cannot conclude without recommending
to the notice of all lovers of beautiful scenery, Bolton Abbey and its
neighbourhood. This enchanting spot belongs to the Duke of Devonshire;
and the superintendence of it has for some years been entrusted to the
Rev. William Carr, who has most skilfully opened out its features; and
in whatever he has added, has done justice to the place, by working with
an invisible hand of art in the very spirit of Nature.

XIV. ECCLESIASTICAL SONNETS.


332. _Ecclesiastical Sonnets in Series_.

ADVERTISEMENT.

During the month of December, 1820, I accompanied a much-beloved and
honoured Friend in a walk through different parts of his estate, with a
view to fix upon the site of a new Church which he intended to erect. It
was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season,--our feelings
were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene; and such
being our purpose, we were naturally led to look back upon past events
with wonder and gratitude, and on the future with hope. Not long
afterwards, some of the Sonnets which will be found towards the close of
this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's
occupation.

The Catholic Question, which was agitated in Parliament about that time,
kept my thoughts in the same course; and it struck me that certain
points in the Ecclesiastical History of our Country might advantageously
be presented to view in verse. Accordingly, I took up the subject, and
what I now offer to the reader was the result.

When this work was far advanced, I was agreeably surprised to find that
my friend, Mr. Southey, had been engaged with similar views in writing a
concise History of the Church _in_ England. If our Productions, thus
unintentionally coinciding, shall be found to illustrate each other, it
will prove a high gratification to me, which I am sure my friend will
participate.

                             W. WORDSWORTH.
Rydal Mount, January 24, 1822.

For the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another
without shocks of abruptness, this work has taken the shape of a series
of Sonnets: but the Reader, it is to be hoped, will find that the
pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of
passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection
but one that bears upon the Poet only--its difficulty.


333. *_Introductory Remarks_.

My purpose in writing this Series was, as much as possible, to confine
my view to the 'introduction, progress, and operation of the CHURCH in
ENGLAND, both previous and subsequent to the Reformation. The Sonnets
were written long before Ecclesiastical History and points of doctrine
had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired
into and discussed. The former particular is mentioned as an excuse for
my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been
selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the Popedom
over temporal sovereignty had attained, and the arrogance with which it
was displayed. I allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series,
where Pope Alexander the Third, at Venice, is described as setting his
foot on the neck of the Emperor Barbarossa. Though this is related as a
fact in history, I am told it is a mere legend of no authority.
Substitute for it an undeniable truth, not less fitted for my purpose,
namely, the penance inflicted by Gregory the Seventh upon the Emperor
Henry the Fourth, at [Canosa].[4]

[4] ('According to Baronius the humiliation of the Emperor was a
voluntary act of prostration on his part. _Ann. Eccl. ad Ann_. 1177.'
_Memoirs_, ii. 111.)

Before I conclude my notice of these Sonnets, let me observe that the
opinion I pronounced in favour of Laud (long before the Oxford Tract
movement), and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters,
is not in the least changed. Omitting here to examine into his conduct
in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged, I
am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had
been abandoned, were good and wise, whatever errors he might commit in
the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them. I further believe,
that had not he, and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did,
stood up in opposition to the Reformers of that period, it is
questionable whether the Church would ever have recovered its lost
ground, and become the blessing it now is, and will, I trust, become in
a still greater degree, both to those of its communion, and those who
unfortunately are separated from it:

    '_ 1 saw the Figure of a lovely Maid_.' [Sonnet I. Part III.]

When I came to this part of the Series I had the dream described in this
sonnet. The figure was that of my daughter, and the whole past exactly
as here represented. The sonnet was composed on the middle road leading
from Grasmere to Ambleside: it was begun as I left the last house in the
vale, and finished, word for word, as it now stands, before I came in
view of Rydal. I wish I could say the same of the five or six hundred I
have written: most of them were frequently retouched in the course of
composition, and not a few laboriously.

I have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted
these Sonnets was erected on Coleorton Moor, towards the centre of a
very populous parish, between three and four miles from
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, on the road to Loughborough, and has proved, I
believe, a great benefit to the neighbourhood.

[POSTSCRIPT.

As an addition to these general remarks on the 'Ecclesiastical Sonnets,'
it seems only right to give here from the _Memoirs_ (vol. ii. p. 113)
the following on Sonnet XL. (Pt. II.):

    'With what entire affection did they prize
    Their _new-born_ Church!'

The invidious inferences that would be drawn from this epithet by the
enemies of the English Church and Reformation are too obvious to be
dilated on. The author was aware of this, and in reply to a friend who
called his attention to the misconstruction and perversion to which the
passage was liable, he replied as follows:

                            'Nov. 12. 1846.
MY DEAR C----,

'The passage which you have been so kind as to comment upon in one of
the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," was altered several years ago by my pen,
in a copy of my poems which I possess, but the correction was not
printed till a place was given it in the last edition, printed last
year, in one volume. It there stands,

     "Their church reformed."

Though for my own part, as I mentioned some time since in a letter I had
occasion to write to the Bishop of ----, I do not like the term
_reformed_; if taken in its literal sense, as a _transformation_, it is
very objectionable.

                            'Yours affectionately,
                                  'W. WORDSWORTH.'

Further, on the Sonnets on 'Aspects of Christianity in America,'
Wordsworth wrote to his valued friend, Professor Reed of Philadelphia,
as follows:

'A few days ago, after a very long interval, I returned to poetical
composition; and my first employment was to write a couple of sonnets
upon subjects recommended by you to take place in the Ecclesiastical
Series. They are upon the Marriage Ceremony and the Funeral Service. I
have also, at the same time, added two others, one upon Visiting the
Sick, and the other upon the Thanksgiving of Women after Childbirth,
both subjects taken from the Services of our Liturgy. To the second part
of the same series, I have also added two, in order to do more justice
to the Papal Church for the services which she did actually render to
Christianity and humanity in the Middle Ages. By the by, the sonnet
beginning, "Men of the Western World," &c. was slightly altered after I
sent it to you, not in the hope of substituting a better verse, but
merely to avoid the repetition of the same word, "book," which occurs as
a rhyme in "The Pilgrim Fathers." These three sonnets, I learn, from
several quarters, have been well received by those of your countrymen
whom they most concern.'] [5]

[5] Extract: September 4th, 1842: _Memoirs_, ii. 389-90.




PART I. FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY INTO BRITAIN TO THE
CONSUMMATION OF THE PAPAL DOMINION.


334. _St. Paul never in Britain_.

     'Did holy Paul,' &c. [Sonnet II. l. 6.]

Stillingfleet adduces many arguments in support of this opinion, but
they are unconvincing. The latter part of this Sonnet (II.
'Conjectures') refers to a favourite notion of Roman Catholic writers,
that Joseph of Arimathea and his companions brought Christianity into
Britain, and built a rude church at Glastonbury; alluded to hereafter in
a passage upon the dissolution of monasteries.


335. _Water-fowl_. [Sonnet III. l. 1.]

     'Screams round the Arch-druid's brow the sea-mew.'

This water-fowl was among the Druids an emblem of those traditions
connected with the deluge that made an important part of their
mysteries. The cormorant was a bird of bad omen.


336. _Hill at St. Allan's: Bede_.

     'That hill, whose flowery platform,' &c. [Sonnet VI. l. 13.]

This hill at St. Alban's must have been an object of great interest to
the imagination of the venerable Bede, who thus describes it, with a
delicate feeling delightful to meet with in that rude age, traces of
which are frequent in his works:--'Variis herbarum floribus depictus imo
usquequaque vestitus, in quo nihil repente arduum, nihil praeceps, nihil
abruptum, quem lateribus longe lateque deductum in modum aequoris natura
complanat, dignum videlicet eum pro insitâ sibi specie venustatis jam
olim reddens, qui beati martyris canore dicaretur.'


337. _Hallelujahs_.

     'Nor wants the cause the panic-striking aid Of hallelujahs.'
     [Sonnet XI. ll. 1-2.]

Alluding to the victory gained under Germanus. See Bede.

338. _Samuel Daniel and Thomas Fuller _. [Ibid. ll. 9-10.]

    'By men yet scarcely conscious of a care
    For other monuments than those of earth.'

The last six lines of this Sonnet are chiefly from the prose of Daniel;
and here I will state (though to the Readers whom this Poem will chiefly
interest it is unnecessary) that my obligations to other prose writers
are frequent,--obligations which, even if I had not a pleasure in
courting, it would have been presumptuous to shun, in treating an
historical subject. I must, however, particularise Fuller, to whom I am
indebted in the Sonnet upon Wycliffe and in other instances. And upon
the acquittal of the Seven Bishops I have done little more than versify
a lively description of that event in the MS. Memoirs of the first Lord
Lonsdale.


339. _Monastery of Old Bangor_. [Sonnet XII.]

After a quotation from Turner's 'valuable History of the Anglo-Saxons.'
Taliesen was present at the battle which preceded this desolation. The
account Bede gives of this remarkable event, suggests a most striking
warning against National and Religious prejudices.


340. _Paulinus_. [Sonnet XV.]

The person of Paulinus is thus described by Bede, from the memory of an
eye-witness: 'Longae staturae, paululum incurvus, nigro capillo, facie
macilenta, naso adunco, pertenui, venerabilis simul et terribilis
aspectu.'


341. _King Edwin and the Sparrow_.

'Man's life is like a sparrow.' [Sonnet XVI. l. 1.]

See the original of this speech in Bede.--The Conversion of Edwin, as
related by him, is highly interesting--and the breaking up of this
Council accompanied with an event so striking and characteristic, that I
am tempted to give it at length in a translation. 'Who, exclaimed the
King, when the Council was ended, shall first desecrate the altars and
the temples? I, answered the Chief Priest; for who more fit than myself,
through the wisdom which the true God hath given me, to destroy, for
the good example of others, what in foolishness is worshipped?
Immediately, casting away vain superstition, he besought the King to
grant him what the laws did not allow to a priest, arms and a courser
(equum emissarium); which mounting, and furnished with a sword and
lance, he proceeded to destroy the Idols. The crowd, seeing this,
thought him mad--he however halted not, but, approaching the profaned
temple, casting against it the lance which he had held in his hand, and,
exulting in acknowledgment of the worship of the true God, he ordered
his companions to pull down the temple, with all its enclosures. The
place is shown where those idols formerly stood, not far from York, at
the source of the river Derwent, and is at this day called Gormund Gaham
ubi pontifex ille, inspirante Deo vero, polluit ac destruxit eas, _quas
ipse sacraverat aras_.' The last expression is a pleasing proof that the
venerable monk of Wearmouth was familiar with the poetry of Virgil.


342. '_Near fresh Streams_.' [Sonnet XVII. l. 12.]

The early propagators of Christianity were accustomed to preach near
rivers for the convenience of baptism.


343. _The Clergy_. [Sonnet XIX.]

Having spoken of the zeal, disinterestedness, and temperance of the
clergy of those times, Bede thus proceeds:--'Unde et in magna erat
veneratione tempore illo religionis habitus, ita ut ubicunque clericus
aliquis, aut monachus adveniret, gaudeutur ab omnibus tanquam Dei
famulus exciperetur. Etiam si in itinere pergens inveniretur,
accurrebant, et flexâ cervice, vel manu signari, vel ore illius se
benedici, gaudebant. Verbis quoque horum exhortatoriis diligenter
auditum praebebant.'--Lib. iii. cap. 26.


343(a). _Bede_. [Sonnet XIII. l. 14.]

He expired dictating the last words of a translation of St. John's
Gospel.


344. _Zeal_.

     'The people work like congregated bees!' [Sonnet XXIV. l. 2.]

See in Turner's History, vol. iii. p. 528, the account of the erection
of Ramsey Monastery. Penances were removable by the performance of acts
of charity and benevolence.


345. _Alfred_.

    ----'pain narrows not his cares.' [Sonnet XXVI. l. 10.]

Through the whole of his life, Alfred was subject to grievous maladies.


346. _Crown and Cowl_.

    'Woe to the Crown that doth the Cowl obey.' [Sonnet XXXIX. l.1.]

The violent measures carried on under the influence of Dunstan, for
strengthening the Benedictine Order, were a leading cause of the second
series of Danish invasions. See Turner.


347. _The Council of Clermont_.

    ----'in awe-stricken countries far and nigh ... that voice resounds.
    [Sonnet XXXIII. ll. 13-14.]

The decision of this Council was believed to be instantly known in
remote parts of Europe.

       *       *       *       *       *




PART II. TO THE CLOSE OF THE TROUBLES IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES I.

348. _Cistertian Monastery_. [Sonnet III.]

'Here man more purely lives,' &c.

'Bonum est nos hic esse, quia homo vivit purius, cadit rarius, surgit
velocius, incedit cautius, quiescit securius, moritur felicius, purgatur
utius, praemiatur copiosius.'--Bernard. 'This sentence,' says Dr.
Whitaker, 'is usually inscribed in some conspicuous part of the
Cistertian houses.'


349. _Waldenses_.

'Whom obloquy pursues with hideous bark.' [Sonnet XIV. l. 8.]

The list of foul names bestowed upon those poor creatures is long and
curious;--and, as is, alas! too natural, most of the opprobrious
appellations are drawn from circumstances into which they were forced by
their persecutors, who even consolidated their miseries into one
reproachful term, calling them Patarenians, or Paturins, from _pati_, to
suffer.

    Dwellers with wolves, she names them, for the pine
    And green oak are their covert; as the gloom
    Of night oft foils their enemy's design,
    She calls them Riders on the flying broom;
    Sorcerers, whose frame and aspect have become
    One and the same through practices malign.


350. _Borrowed Lines_.

    'And the green lizard and the gilded newt
    Lead unmolested lives, and die of age.' [Sonnet XXI. ll. 7-8.]

These two lines are adopted from a MS., written about 1770, which
accidentally fell into my possession. The close of the preceding Sonnet
'On Monastic Voluptuousness' is taken from the same source, as is the
verse, 'Where Venus sits,' &c., and the line, 'Once ye were holy, ye are
holy still,' in a subsequent Sonnet.


851. _Transfiguration_.

    'One (like those prophets whom God sent of old)
    Transfigured,' &c. [Sonnet XXXIV. ll. 4-5.]

'M. Latimer suffered his keeper very quietly to pull off his hose, and
his other array, which to looke unto was very simple: and being stripped
unto his shrowd, he seemed as comely a person to them that were present,
as one should lightly see: and whereas in his clothes hee appeared a
withered and crooked sillie (weak) olde man, he now stood bolt upright,
as comely a father as one might lightly behold.... Then they brought a
faggotte, kindled with fire, and laid the same downe at doctor Ridley's
feete. To whome M. Latimer spake in this manner, "Bee of good comfort,
master Ridley, and play the man: wee shall this day light such a candle
by God's grace in England, as I trust shall never bee put out."'--_Fox's
Acts, &c._

Similar alterations in the outward figure and deportment of persons
brought to like trial were not uncommon. See note to the above passage
in Dr. Wordsworth's Ecclesiastical Biography, for an example in an
humble Welsh fisherman.


352. _Craft_.

    ----'craftily incites
    The overweening, personates the mad.' [Sonnet XLI. l. 11.]

A common device in religious and political conflicts. See Strype in
support of this instance.

353. _The Virgin Mountain_. [Sonnet XLIII.]

Jung-frau.


354. _Laud_. [Sonnet XLV.]

In this age a word cannot be said in praise of Laud, or even in
compassion for his fate, without incurring a charge of bigotry; but
fearless of such imputation, I concur with Hume, 'that it is sufficient
for his vindication to observe that his errors were the most excusable
of all those which prevailed during that zealous period.' A key to the
right understanding of those parts of his conduct that brought the most
odium upon him in his own time, may be found in the following passage of
his speech before the bar of the House of Peers:--'Ever since I came in
place, I have laboured nothing more than that the external publick
worship of God, so much slighted in divers parts of this kingdom, might
be preserved, and that with as much decency and uniformity as might be.
For I evidently saw that the publick neglect of God's service in the
outward face of it, and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that
service, _had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of
God, which while we live in the body, needs external helps, and all
little enough to keep it in any vigour_.'

       *       *       *       *       *


PART III. FROM THE RESTORATION TO THE PRESENT TIME.

355. _The Pilgrim Fathers_. [Sonnet XIII.]

American episcopacy, in union with the church in England, strictly
belongs to the general subject; and I here make my acknowledgments to my
American friends, Bishop Doane, and Mr. Henry Reed of Philadelphia, for
having suggested to me the propriety of adverting to it, and pointed out
the virtues and intellectual qualities of Bishop White, which so
eminently fitted him for the great work he undertook. Bishop White was
consecrated at Lambeth, Feb. 4, 1787, by Archbishop Moor; and before his
long life was closed, twenty-six bishops had been consecrated in
America, by himself. For his character and opinions, see his own
numerous Works, and a 'Sermon in commemoration of him, by George
Washington Doane, Bishop of New Jersey.'

356. _The Clergyman_.

    'A genial hearth----
    And a refined rusticity, belong
    To the neat mansion.' [Sonnet XVIII. ll. 1-3.]

Among the benefits arising, as Mr. Coleridge has well observed, from a
Church Establishment of endowments corresponding with the wealth of the
country to which it belongs, may be reckoned as eminently important, the
examples of civility and refinement which the Clergy stationed at
intervals, afford to the whole people. The Established clergy in many
parts of England have long been, as they continue to be, the principal
bulwark against barbarism, and the link which unites the sequestered
peasantry with the intellectual advancement of the age. Nor is it below
the dignity of the subject to observe, that their taste, as acting upon
rural residences and scenery often furnishes models which country
gentlemen, who are more at liberty to follow the caprices of fashion,
might profit by. The precincts of an old residence must be treated by
ecclesiastics with respect, both from prudence and necessity. I remember
being much pleased, some years ago, at Rose Castle, the rural seat of
the See of Carlisle, with a style of garden and architecture, which, if
the place had belonged to a wealthy layman, would no doubt have been
swept away. A parsonage-house generally stands not far from the church;
this proximity imposes favourable restraints, and sometimes suggests an
affecting union of the accommodations and elegances of life with the
outward signs of piety and mortality. With pleasure I recall to mind a
happy instance of this in the residence of an old and much-valued Friend
in Oxfordshire. The house and church stand parallel to each other, at a
small distance; a circular lawn or rather grass-plot, spreads between
them; shrubs and trees curve from each side of the dwelling, veiling,
but not hiding, the church. From the front of this dwelling, no part of
the burial-ground is seen; but as you wind by the side of the shrubs
towards the steeple-end of the church, the eye catches a single, small,
low, monumental headstone, moss-grown, sinking into, and gently
inclining towards the earth. Advance, and the churchyard, populous and
gay with glittering tombstones, opens upon the view. This humble and
beautiful parsonage called forth a tribute, for which see the seventh of
the 'Miscellaneous Sonnets,' Part III.


357. _Rush-bearing_. [Sonnet XXXII.]

This is still continued in many churches in Westmoreland. It takes place
in the month of July, when the floor of the stalls is strewn with fresh
rushes; and hence it is called the 'Rush-bearing.'


358. _George Dyer_.

    'Teaching us to forget them or forgive.' [Sonnet XXXV. l. 10.]

This is borrowed from an affecting passage in Mr. George Dyer's History
of Cambridge.


359. _Apprehension_.

    ----'had we, like them, endured
    Sore stress of apprehension.' [Sonnet XXXVII. l. 6.]

See Burnet, who is unusually animated on this subject; the east wind, so
anxiously expected and prayed for, was called the 'Protestant wind.'


360. _The Cross_.

    'Yet will we not conceal the precious Cross,
    Like men ashamed.' [Sonnet XL. ll. 9-10.]

The Lutherans have retained the Cross within their churches: it is to be
regretted that we have not done the same.


361. _Monte Rosa_.

    Or like the Alpine Mount, that takes its name
    From roseate hues,' &c. [Sonnet XLVI. ll. 5-6.]

Some say that Monte Rosa takes its name from a belt of rock at its
summit--a very unpoetical and scarcely a probable supposition.




XV. 'YARROW REVISITED,' AND OTHER POEMS.

COMPOSED (TWO EXCEPTED) DURING A TOUR IN SCOTLAND, AND ON THE ENGLISH
BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.


362. _Dedication_.

TO SAMUEL ROGERS, ESQ.

     As a testimony of friendship, and acknowledgment of intellectual
     obligations, these Memorials are affectionately inscribed.

Rydal Mount, Dec. 11, 1834.

The following stanzas ['Yarrow Revisited'] are a memorial of a day
passed with Sir Walter Scott, and other friends, visiting the banks of
the Yarrow under his guidance, immediately before his departure from
Abbotsford for Naples.

The title 'Yarrow Revisited' will stand in no need of explanation, for
Readers acquainted with the Author's previous poems suggested by that
celebrated stream.


363. *_Yarrow Revisited_.

I first became acquainted with this great and amiable man (Sir Walter
Scott) in the year 1803, when my sister and I, making a tour in
Scotland, were hospitably received by him in Lasswade, upon the banks of
the Esk, where he was then living. We saw a good deal of him in the
course of the following week. The particulars are given in my sister's
journal of that tour.


(2) *_Ibid._

In the autumn of 1831, my daughter and I set off from Rydal to visit Sir
Walter Scott, before his departure for Italy. This journey had been
delayed, by an inflammation in my eyes, till we found that the time
appointed for his leaving home would be too near for him to receive us
without considerable inconvenience. Nevertheless, we proceeded, and
reached Abbotsford on Monday. I was then scarcely able to lift up my
eyes to the light. How sadly changed did I find him from the man I had
seen so healthy, gay, and hopeful a few years before, when he said at
the inn at Paterdale, in my presence, his daughter Anne also being
there, with Mr. Lockhart, my own wife and daughter, and Mr. Quillinan,
'I mean to live till I am eighty, and shall write as long as I live.'
Though we had none of us the least thought of the cloud of misfortune
which was then going to break upon his head, I was startled, and almost
shocked, at that bold saying, which could scarcely be uttered by such a
man, sanguine as he was, without a momentary forgetfulness of the
instability of human life. But to return to Abbotsford. The inmates and
guests we found there were Sir Walter, Major Scott, Anne Scott, and Mr.
and Mrs. Lockhart; Mr. Liddell, his lady and brother, and Mr. Allan, the
painter, and Mr. Laidlaw, a very old friend of Sir Walter's. One of
Burns's sons, an officer in the Indian service, had left the house a day
or two before, and had kindly expressed his regret that he could not
wait my arrival, a regret that I may truly say was mutual. In the
evening, Mr. and Mrs. Liddell sang, and Mrs. Lockhart chaunted old
ballads to her harp; and Mr. Allan, hanging over the back of a chair,
told and acted odd stories in a humorous way. With this exhibition, and
his daughter's singing, Sir Walter was much amused, and, indeed, were we
all, as far as circumstances would allow. But what is most worthy of
mention is the admirable demeanour of Major Scott during that
evening.[6] He had much to suffer from the sight of his father's
infirmities and from the great change that was about to take place at
the residence he had built, and where he had long lived in so much
prosperity and happiness. But what struck me most was the patient
kindness with which he supported himself under the many fretful
expressions that his sister Anne addressed to him or uttered in his
hearing, and she, poor thing, as mistress of that house, had been
subject, after her mother's death, to a heavier load of care and
responsibility, and greater sacrifices of time, than one of such a
constitution of body and mind was able to bear. Of this Dora and I were
made so sensible, that as soon as we had crossed the Tweed on our
departure, we gave vent at the same moment to our apprehensions that her
brain would fail and she would go out of her mind, or that she would
sink under the trials she had passed and those which awaited her.

[6] In pencil--This is a mistake, dear Father. It was the following
evening, when the Liddells were gone, and only ourselves and Mr. Allan
present.

On Tuesday morning, Sir Walter Scott accompanied us, and most of the
party, to Newark Castle, on the _Yarrow_. When we alighted from the
carriages, he walked pretty stoutly, and had great pleasure in
revisiting these his favourite haunts. Of that excursion, the verses,
'Yarrow Revisited' are a memorial. Notwithstanding the romance that
pervades Sir Walter's works, and attaches to many of his habits, there
is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonise, as much as I
could wish, with the two preceding poems. On our return in the
afternoon, we had to cross the Tweed, directly opposite Abbotsford. The
wheels of our carriage grated upon the pebbles in the bed of the stream,
that there flows somewhat rapidly. A rich, but sad light, of rather a
purple than a golden hue, was spread over the Eildon Hills at that
moment; and, thinking it probable that it might be the last time Sir
Walter would cross the stream, I was not a little moved, and expressed
some of my feelings in the sonnet beginning,

    'A trouble, not of clouds,' &c.

At noon on Thursday we left Abbotsford, and on the morning of that day,
Sir Walter and I had a serious conversation, _tête-à-tête_, when he
spoke with gratitude of the happy life which, upon the whole, he had
led. He had written in my daughter's album, before he came into the
breakfast-room that morning, a few stanzas addressed to her; and while
putting the book into her hand, in his own Study, standing by his desk,
he said to her in my presence, 'I should not have done any thing of this
kind, but for your father's sake; they are probably the last verses I
shall ever write.' They show how much his mind was impaired; not by the
strain of thought, but by the execution, some of the lines being
imperfect, and one stanza wanting corresponding rhymes. One letter, the
initial S., had been omitted in the spelling of his own name. In this
interview, also, it was that, upon my expressing a hope of his health
being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going, and
by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of Italy, he
made use of the quotation from 'Yarrow Revisited,' as recorded by me in
the 'Musings at Aquapendente,' six years afterwards.

Mr. Lockhart has mentioned in his life of him, what I heard from several
quarters while abroad, both at Rome and elsewhere, that little seemed to
interest him but what he could collect or heard of the fugitive Stuarts,
and their adherents who had followed them into exile. Both the 'Yarrow
Revisited' and the 'Sonnet' were sent him before his departure from
England. Some further particulars of the conversations which occurred
during this visit I should have set down, had they not been already
accurately recorded by Mr. Lockhart.


364. *_A Place of Burial in the South of Scotland_. [III.]

Similar places for burial are not unfrequent in Scotland. The one that
suggested this sonnet lies on the banks of a small stream, called the
Wauchope, that flows into the Esk near Langholme. Mickle, who, as it
appears from his poem on Sir Martin, was not without genuine poetic
feelings, was born and passed his boyhood in this neighbourhood, under
his father, who was a minister of the Scotch Kirk. The Esk, both above
and below Langholme, flows through a beautiful country; and the two
streams of the Wauchope and the Ewes, which join it near that place, are
such as a pastoral poet would delight in.


365. *_On the Sight of a Manse in the South of Scotland_. [IV.]

The manses in Scotland, and the gardens and grounds about them, have
seldom that attractive appearance which is common about our English
parsonages, even when the clergyman's income falls below the average of
the Scotch minister's. This is not merely owing to the one country being
poor in comparison with the other, but arises rather out of the equality
of their benefices, so that no one has enough to spare for decorations
that might serve as an example for others, whereas with us the taste of
the richer incumbent extends its influence more or less to the poorest.

After all, in these observations, the surface only of the matter is
touched. I once heard a conversation, in which the Roman Catholic
religion was decried on account of its abuses: 'You cannot deny,
however,' said a lady of the party, repeating an expression used by
Charles II., 'that it is the religion of a gentleman.' It may be left to
the Scotch themselves to determine how far this observation applies to
the [religion] of their Kirk; while it cannot be denied [that] if it is
wanting in that characteristic quality, the aspect of common life, so
far as concerns its beauty, must suffer. Sincere Christian piety may be
thought not to stand in need of refinement or studied ornament, but
assuredly it is ever ready to adopt them, when they fall within its
notice, as means allow: and this observation applies not only to
manners, but to everything that a Christian (truly so in spirit)
cultivates and gathers round him, however humble his social condition.


366. *_Composed in Roslin Chapel during a Storm_. [V.]

We were detained, by incessant rain and storm, at the small inn near
Roslin Chapel, and I passed a great part of the day pacing to and fro in
this beautiful structure, which, though not used for public service, is
not allowed to go to ruin. Here this sonnet was composed, and [I shall
be fully satisfied] if it has at all done justice to the feeling which
the place and the storm raging without inspired. I was as a prisoner. A
Painter delineating the interior of the chapel and its minute features,
under such circumstances, would have no doubt found his time agreeably
shortened. But the movements of the mind must be more free while dealing
with words than with lines and colours. Such, at least, was then, and
has been on many other occasions, my belief; and as it is allotted to
few to follow both arts with success, I am grateful to my own calling
for this and a thousand other recommendations which are denied to that
of the Painter.


367. *_The Trosachs_. [VI.]

As recorded in my Sister's Journal, I had first seen the Trosachs in her
and Coleridge's company. The sentiment that runs through this sonnet was
natural to the season in which I again saw this beautiful spot; but
this, and some other sonnets that follow, were coloured by the
remembrance of my recent visit to Sir Walter Scott, and the melancholy
errand on which he was going.


368. *_Composed in the Glen of Lock Etive_. [VIII.]

    'That make the patriot spirit.'

It was mortifying to have frequent occasions to observe the bitter
hatred of the lower orders of the Highlanders to their superiors: love
of country seemed to have passed into its opposite. Emigration was the
only relief looked to with hope.


369. _Eagles: composed at Dunollie Castle in the Bay of Oban_. [IX.]

The last I saw was on the wing, off the promontory of Fairhead, county
of Antrim. I mention this, because, though my tour in Ireland, with Mr.
Marshall and his son, was made many years ago, this allusion to the
eagle is the only image supplied by it to the poetry I have since
written. We travelled through the country in October; and to the
shortness of the days, and the speed with which we travelled (in a
carriage-and-four), may be ascribed this want of notices, in my verse,
of a country so interesting. The deficiency I am somewhat ashamed of,
and it is the more remarkable, as contrasted with my Scotch and
continental tours, of which are to be found in these volumes so many
memorials.


370. *_In the Sound of Mull_. [X.]

Touring late in the season in Scotland is an uncertain speculation. We
were detained a week by rain at Bunaw, on Loch Etive, in a vain hope
that the weather would clear up, and allow me to show my daughter the
beauties of Glencoe. Two days we were at the Isle of Mull, on a visit to
Major Campbell; but it rained incessantly, and we were obliged to give
up our intention of going to Staffa. The rain pursued us to Tyndrum,
where the next sonnet was composed in a storm.


371. '_Shepherds of Etive Glen_.' [X.]

In Gaelic--Buachaill Eite.


372. _Highland Broach_. [XV.]

On ascending a hill that leads from Loch Awe towards Inverary, I fell
into conversation with a woman of the humbler class, who wore one of
these Highland broaches. I talked with her about it, and upon parting
with her, when I said, with a kindness I truly felt, 'May the broach
continue in your family for many generations to come, as you have
already possessed it,' she thanked me most becomingly, and seemed not a
little moved. The exact resemblance which the old broach (still in use,
though rarely met with among the Highlanders) bears to the Roman Fibula
must strike every one, and concurs, with the plaid and kilt, to recall
to mind the communication which the ancient Romans had with this remote
country.

[Note.--How much the Broach is sometimes prized by persons in humble
stations may be gathered from an occurrence mentioned to me by a female
friend. She had an opportunity of benefiting a poor old woman in her own
hut, who, wishing to make a return, said to her daughter in Erse, in a
tone of plaintive earnestness, 'I would give anything I have, but I
_hope_ she does not wish for my Broach!' and uttering these words she
put her hand upon the Broach which fastened her kerchief, and which she
imagined had attracted the eye of her benefactress.]


373. _The Brownie_. [XVI.]

Upon a small island not far from the head of Loch Lomond, are some
remains of an ancient building, which was for several years the abode of
a solitary Individual, one of the last survivors of the clan of
Macfarlane, once powerful in that neighbourhood. Passing along the shore
opposite this island in the year 1814, the Author learned these
particulars, and that this person then living there had acquired the
appellation of 'The Brownie.' See 'The Brownie's Cell' ['Memorials of a
Tour in Scotland, 1814,' I.], to which the following is a sequel.


374. *_Bothwell Castle_. [XVIII.]

In my Sister's Journal is an account of Bothwell Castle as it appeared
to us at that time.


375. *_The Avon: a Feeder of the Avon_. [XX. l. 2.]

    'Yet is it one that other rivulets bear.'

There is the Shakspeare Avon, the Bristol Avon, the one that flows by
Salisbury, and a small river in Wales, I believe, bear the name; Avon
being, in the ancient tongue, the general name for river.


376. *_Suggested by a View from an Eminence in Inglewood Forest_.
[XXI.]

The extensive forest of Inglewood has been enclosed within my memory. I
was well acquainted with it in its ancient state. The Hartshorn tree,
mentioned in the next sonnet, was one of its remarkable objects, as well
as another tree that grew upon an eminence not far from Penrith. It was
single and conspicuous, and, being of a round shape, though it was
universally known to be a 'sycamore,' it was always called the 'Round
Thorn,' so difficult is it to chain fancy down to fact.


377. _Hart's-Horn Tree, near Penrith_. [XXII.]

[After a quotation from Nicholson and Burns's History of Westmoreland
and Cumberland.] The tree has now disappeared, but I well remember its
imposing appearance as it stood, in a decayed state, by the side of the
high road leading from Penrith to Appleby. The whole neighbourhood
abounds in interesting traditions and vestiges of antiquity, viz.,
Julian's Bower; Brougham and Penrith Castles; Penrith Beacon, and the
curious remains in Penrith Churchyard; Arthur's Round Table, and, close
by, Maybrough; the excavation, called the Giant's Cave, on the banks of
the Emont; Long Meg and her daughters, near Eden, &c., &c.


378. _Fancy and Tradition_. [XXIII.]

Suggested by the recollection of Juliana's bower and other traditions
connected with this ancient forest.


379. _Countess' Pillar_. [XXIV.]

On the road-side between Penrith and Appleby there stands a pillar with
the following inscription:--

     'This pillar was erected in the year 1656, by Anne Countess Dowager
     of Pembroke, &c. for a memorial of her last parting with her pious
     mother, Margaret Countess Dowager of Cumberland, on the 2d April,
     1616; in memory whereof she hath left an annuity of £4, to be
     distributed to the poor of the parish of Brougham, every 2d day of
     April for ever, upon the stone table placed hard by. _Laus Deo_!'

       *       *       *       *       *




XVI. EVENING VOLUNTARIES.


380. _Lines composed on a high part of the coast of Cumberland, Easter
Sunday, April 7th, the Author's sixty-third birthday_. [II.]

The lines were composed on the road between Moresby and Whitehaven,
while I was on a visit to my son, then rector of Moresby. This
succession of Voluntaries, with the exception of the 8th and 9th,
originated in the concluding lines of the last paragraph of this poem.
With this coast I have been familiar from my earliest childhood, and
remember being struck for the first time by the town and port of
Whitehaven, and the white waves breaking against its quays and piers, as
the whole came into view from the top of the high ground down which the
road,--which has since been altered,--then descended abruptly. My
sister, when she first heard the voice of the sea from this point, and
beheld the scene spread before her, burst into tears. Our family then
lived at Cockermouth, and this fact was often mentioned among us as
indicating the sensibility for which she was so remarkable.


381. *_By the Sea-side_. [III.]

These lines were suggested during my residence under my son's roof at
Moresby on the coast near Whitehaven, at the time when I was composing
those verses among the Evening Voluntaries that have reference to the
Sea. In some future edition I purpose to place it among that class of
poems. It was in that neighbourhood I first became acquainted with the
ocean and its appearances and movements. My infancy and early childhood
were passed at Cockermouth, about eight miles from the coast, and I well
remember that mysterious awe with which I used to listen to anything
said about storms and shipwrecks. Sea-shells of many descriptions were
common in the town, and I was not a little surprised when I heard Mr.
Landor had denounced me as a Plagiarist from himself for having
described a boy applying a sea-shell to his ear, and listening to it for
intimation of what was going on in its native element. This I had done
myself scores of times, and it was a belief among us that we could know
from the sound whether the tide was ebbing or flowing.


382. _Not in the lucid intervals of life_. [IV.]

The lines following, 'Nor do words,' &c., were written with Lord Byron's
character as a poet before me, and that of others among his
contemporaries, who wrote under like influences.


383. _The leaves that rustled on this oak-crowned hill_. [VII.]

Composed by the side of Grasmere Lake. The mountains that enclose the
vale, especially towards Easedale, are most favourable to the
reverberation of sound: there is a passage in 'The Excursion,' towards
the close of the 4th book, where the voice of the raven in flight is
traced through the modifications it undergoes, as I have often heard it
in that vale and others of this district.


384. _Impromptu_. [VIII.]

This Impromptu appeared, many years ago, among the Author's Poems, from
which, in subsequent editions, it was excluded. It is reprinted at the
request of the Friend in whose presence the lines were thrown off.


384a. *_Ibid._

Reprinted at the request of my Sister, in whose presence the lines were
thrown off.


385. *_Composed upon an Evening of extraordinary Splendour and Beauty_
[IX.]

Felt, and in a great measure composed, upon the little mount in front of
our abode at Rydal. In concluding my notices of this class of poems it
may be as well to observe, that among the Miscellaneous Sonnets are a
few alluding to morning impressions, which might be read with mutual
benefit in connection with these Evening Voluntaries. See for example
that one on Westminster Bridge, that on May 2d, on the song of the
Thrush, and the one beginning 'While beams of orient light.'


386. _Alston: American Painter_.

    'Wings at my shoulder seem to play' (IX. iii. l. 9).

In these lines I am under obligation to the exquisite picture of
'Jacob's Dream,' by Mr. Alston, now in America. It is pleasant to make
this public acknowledgment to a man of genius, whom I have the honour to
rank among my friends.


387. _Mountain-ridges_. [_Ibid._ IV. l. 20.]

The multiplication of mountain-ridges, described at the commencement of
the third stanza of this Ode as a kind of Jacob's Ladder, leading to
Heaven, is produced either by watery vapours or sunny haze; in the
present instance by the latter cause. Allusions to the Ode, entitled
'Intimations of Immortality,' pervade the last stanza of the foregoing
Poem.




XVII. POEMS COMPOSED OR SUGGESTED DURING A TOUR IN THE SUMMER OF 1833.


388. _Advertisement_.

Having been prevented by the lateness of the season, in 1831, from
visiting Staffa and Iona, the author made these the principal objects of
a short tour in the summer of 1833, of which the following series of
poems is a Memorial. The course pursued was down the Cumberland river
Derwent, and to Whitehaven; thence (by the Isle of Man, where a few days
were passed,) up the Frith of Clyde to Greenock, then to Oban, Staffa,
Iona, and back towards England by Loch Awe, Inverary, Loch Goil-head,
Greenock, and through parts of Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, and Dumfriesshire
to Carlisle, and thence up the River Eden, and homeward by Ullswater.


389. _The Greta_.

    'But if thou, like Cocytus,' &c. (IV. l. 5).

Many years ago, when I was at Greta Bridge, in Yorkshire, the hostess of
the inn, proud of her skill in etymology, said, that 'the name of the
river was taken from the _bridge_, the form of which, as every one must
notice, exactly resembled a great A.' Dr. Whitaker has derived it from
the word of common occurrence in the north of England, '_to greet_;'
signifying to lament aloud, mostly with weeping; a conjecture rendered
more probable from the stony and rocky channel of both the Cumberland
and Yorkshire rivers. The Cumberland Greta, though it does not, among
the country people, take up _that_ name till within three miles of its
disappearance in the river Derwent, may be considered as having its
source in the mountain cove of Wythburn, and flowing through Thirlmere,
the beautiful features of which lake are known only to those who,
travelling between Grasmere and Keswick, have quitted the main road in
the vale of Wythburn, and, crossing over to the opposite side of the
lake, have proceeded with it on the right hand.

The channel of the Greta, immediately above Keswick, has, for the
purposes of building, been in a great measure cleared of the immense
stones which, by their concussion in high floods, produced the loud and
awful noises described in the sonnet.

'The scenery upon this river,' says Mr. Southey in his Colloquies,
'where it passes under the woody side of Latrigg, is of the finest and
most rememberable kind:

    ----"ambiguo lapsu refluitque fluitque,
    Occurrensque sibi venturas aspicit undas."'


390. _Brigham Church_.

    'By hooded votaresses,' &c. (VIII. l. 11).

Attached to the church of Brigham was formerly a chantry, which held a
moiety of the manor; and in the decayed parsonage some vestiges of
monastic architecture are still to be seen.


391. *_Nun's Well, Brigham_. [VIII.]

So named from the Religious House which stood close by. I have rather an
odd anecdote to relate of the Nun's Well. One day the landlady of a
public house, a field's length from it, on the road-side, said to me,
'You have been to see the Nun's Well, sir.' 'The Nun's Well! What is
that?' said the postman, who in his royal livery stopt his mail-car at
the door. The landlady and I explained to him what the name meant, and
what sort of people the nuns were. A countryman who was standing by
rather tipsy stammered out, 'Ay, those Nuns were good people; they are
gone, but we shall soon have them back again.' The Reform mania was just
then at its height.


392. *_To a Friend_. [IX.]

    'Pastor and Patriot.'

My son John, who was then building a parsonage on his small living at
Brigham.


393. _Mary Queen of Scots landing at Workington_. [X.]

'The fears and impatience of Mary were so great,' says Robertson, 'that
she got into a fisher-boat, and with about twenty attendants landed at
Workington, in Cumberland; and thence she was conducted with many marks
of respect to Carlisle.' The apartment in which the Queen had slept at
Workington Hall (where she was received by Sir Henry Curwen as became
her rank and misfortunes) was long preserved, out of respect to her
memory, as she had left it; and one cannot but regret that some
necessary alterations in the mansion could not be effected without its
destruction.


394. *_Mary Queen of Scots_.[X.]

    'Bright as a star.'

I will mention for the sake of the friend who is writing down these
Notes that it was among the fine Scotch firs near Ambleside, and
particularly those near Green Bank, that I have over and over again
paused at the sight of this image. Long may they stand to afford a like
gratification to others! This wish is not uncalled for--several of their
brethren having already disappeared.

N.B. The Poem of St. Bees to follow at this place.


395. _St. Bees and Charlotte Smith_. [XI.]

St. Bees' Heads, anciently called the Cliff of Baruth, are a conspicuous
sea-mark for all vessels sailing in the N.E. parts of the Irish Sea. In
a bay, one side of which is formed by the southern headland, stands the
village of St. Bees; a place distinguished, from very early times, for
its religious and scholastic foundations.

'St. Bees,' say Nicholson and Burns, 'had its name from Bega, an holy
woman from Ireland, who is said to have founded here, about the year of
our Lord 650, a small monastery, where afterwards a church was built in
memory of her.

'The aforesaid religious house, being destroyed by the Danes, was
restored by William de Meschiens, son of Ranulph, and brother of Ranulph
de Meschiens, first Earl of Cumberland after the Conquest; and made a
cell of a prior and six Benedictine monks to the Abbey of St. Mary at
York.'

Several traditions of miracles, connected with the foundation of the
first of these religious houses, survive among the people of the
neighbourhood; one of which is alluded to in these Stanzas; and another,
of a somewhat bolder and more peculiar character, has furnished the
subject of a spirited poem by the Rev. R. Parkinson, M.A., late Divinity
Lecturer of St. Bees' College, and now Fellow of the Collegiate Church
of Manchester.

After the dissolution of the monasteries, Archbishop Grindal founded a
free school at St. Bees, from which the counties of Cumberland and
Westmoreland have derived great benefit; and recently, under the
patronage of the Earl of Lonsdale, a college has been established there
for the education of ministers for the English Church. The old
Conventual Church has been repaired under the superintendence of the
Rev. Dr. Ainger, the Head of the College; and is well worthy of being
visited by any strangers who might be led to the neighbourhood of this
celebrated spot.

The form of stanza in this Poem, and something in the style of
versification, are adopted from the 'St. Monica,' a poem of much beauty
upon a monastic subject, by Charlotte Smith: a lady to whom English
verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either
acknowledged or remembered. She wrote little, and that little
unambitiously, but with true feeling for rural Nature, at a time when
Nature was not much regarded by English Poets; for in point of time her
earlier writings preceded, I believe, those of Cowper and Burns.


396. _Requiems_.

    'Are not, in sooth, their Requiems sacred ties?' (XI. l. 73.)

I am aware that I am here treading upon tender ground; but to the
intelligent reader I feel that no apology is due. The prayers of
survivors, during passionate grief for the recent loss of relatives and
friends, as the object of those prayers could no longer be the suffering
body of the dying, would naturally be ejaculated for the souls of the
departed; the barriers between the two worlds dissolving before the
power of love and faith. The ministers of religion, from their habitual
attendance upon sick-beds, would be daily witnesses of these benign
results; and hence would be strongly tempted to aim at giving to them
permanence, by embodying them in rites and ceremonies, recurring at
stated periods. All this, as it was in course of nature, so was it
blameless, and even praiseworthy; since some of its effects, in that
rude state of society, could not but be salutary. No reflecting person,
however, can view without sorrow the abuses which rose out of thus
formalising sublime instincts and disinterested movements of passion,
and perverting them into means of gratifying the ambition and rapacity
of the priesthood. But, while we deplore and are indignant at these
abuses, it would be a great mistake if we imputed the origin of the
offices to prospective selfishness on the part of the monks and clergy;
_they_ were at first sincere in their sympathy, and in their degree
dupes rather of their own creed than artful and designing men. Charity
is, upon the whole, the safest guide that we can take in judging our
fellow-men, whether of past ages or of the present time.


397. _Sir William Hillary_.

     'And they are led by noble Hillary' (XV. l. 14).

The TOWER OF REFUGE, an ornament to Douglas Bay, was erected chiefly
through the humanity and zeal of Sir William Hillary; and he also was
the founder of the lifeboat establishment at that place; by which, under
his superintendence, and often by his exertions at the imminent hazard
of his own life, many seamen and passengers have been saved.


398. _Isle of Man_. [XVI. l. 14.]

The sea-water on the coast of the Isle of Man is singularly pure and
beautiful.


399. *_Isle of Man_. [XVII.]

My son William is here the person alluded to as saving the life of the
youth; and the circumstances were as mentioned in the Sonnet.


400. *_By a retired Mariner_. [XIX.]

Mary's brother Henry.


401. *_At Bala Sala_. [XX.]

A thankful refuge. Supposed to be written by a friend (Mr. Cookson) who
died there a few years after.


402. *_Tynwald Hill_.

Mr. Robinson and I walked the greater part of the way from Castle-Town
to Peel, and stopped some time at Tynwald Hill. My companions were an
elderly man, who in a muddy way (for he was tipsy) explained and
answered as far as he could my enquiries about the place and the
ceremonies held here. I found more agreeable company in some little
children, one of whom, upon my request, recited the Lord's Prayer to me,
and I helped her to a clearer understanding of it as well as I could;
but I was not at all satisfied with my own part. Hers was much better
done; and I am persuaded that, like other children, she knew more about
it than she was able to express, especially to a stranger.


403. _Snafell_.

    'Off with you cloud, old Snafell' (Sonnet XXI. l. 9).

The summit of this mountain is well chosen by Cowley as the scene of the
'Vision,' in which the spectral angel discourses with him concerning the
government of Oliver Cromwell. 'I found myself,' says he, 'on the top of
that famous hill in the Island Mona, which has the prospect of three
great, and not long since most happy, kingdoms. As soon as ever I looked
upon them, they called forth the sad representation of all the sins and
all the miseries that had overwhelmed them these twenty years.' It is
not to be denied that the changes now in progress, and the passions, and
the way in which they work, strikingly resemble those which led to the
disasters the philosophic writer so feelingly bewails. God grant that
the resemblance may not become still more striking as months and years
advance!


404. _Eagle in Mosaic_. [Sonnet XXV.]

    'On revisiting Dunolly Castle.'

This ingenious piece of workmanship, as I afterwards learned, had been
executed for their own amusement by some labourers employed about the
place.


405. *_In the Frith of Clyde_.--_Ailsa Crag during an eclipse of the
sun, July_ 17, 1833. [XXIII.]

The morning of the eclipse was exquisitely beautiful while we passed the
Crag, as described in the sonnet. On the deck of the steamboat were
several persons of the poor and labouring class; and I could not but be
struck with their cheerful talk with each other, while not one of them
seemed to notice the magnificent objects with which we were surrounded;
and even the phenomenon of the eclipse attracted but little of their
attention. Was it right not to regret this? They appeared to me,
however, so much alive in their own minds to their own concerns that I
could not but look upon it as a misfortune that they had little
perception for such pleasures as cannot be cultivated without ease and
leisure. Yet, if one surveys life in all its duties and relations, such
ease and leisure will not be found so enviable a privilege as it may at
first appear. Natural philosophy, painting, and poetry, and refined
taste, are no doubt great acquisitions to society; but among those who
dedicate themselves to such pursuits it is to be feared that few are as
happy and as consistent in the management of their lives as the class of
persons who at that time led me into this course of reflection. I do not
mean by this to be understood to derogate from intellectual pursuits,
for that would be monstrous. I say it in deep gratitude for this
compensation to those whose cares are limited to the necessities of
daily life. Among them, self-tormentors, so numerous in the higher
classes of society, are rare.


406. *_On the Frith of Clyde_.--_In a Steamboat_, [XXIV.]

The mountain outline on the north of this island [Arran], as seen from
the Frith of Clyde, is much the finest I have ever noticed in Scotland
or elsewhere.


407. '_There, said a Stripling_.' [XXXVII.]

Mosgiel was thus pointed out to me by a young man, on the top of the
coach on my way from Glasgow to Kilmarnock. It is remarkable, that
though Burns lived some time here, and during much the most productive
period of his poetical life, he nowhere adverts to the splendid
prospects stretching towards the sea, and bounded by the peaks of Arran
on one part, which in clear weather he must have had daily before his
eyes. Yet this is easily explained. In one of his poetical effusions he
speaks of describing 'fair Nature's face,' as a privilege on which he
sets a high value; nevertheless, natural appearances rarely take a lead
in his poetry. It is as a human being, eminently sensitive and
intelligent, and not as a poet clad in his priestly robes and carrying
the ensigns of sacerdotal office, that he interests and affects us.

Whether he speaks of rivers, hills, and woods, it is not so much on
account of the properties with which they are absolutely endowed, as
relatively to local patriotic remembrances and associations, or as they
are ministerial to personal feelings, especially those of love, whether
happy or otherwise; yet it is not _always_ so. Soon after we had passed
Mosgiel Farm we crossed the Ayr, murmuring and winding through a narrow
woody hollow. His line,

    'Auld hermit Ayr staw thro' his woods,' [=stole]

came at once to my mind, with Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, and Doon, Ayrshire
streams over which he breathes a sigh, as being unnamed in song; and,
surely, his own attempts to make them known were as successful as his
heart could desire.


408. *_Written on a Blank Leaf of Macpherson's 'Ossian_.' [XXVII]

This poem should, for variety's sake, take its place among the itinerary
Sonnets on one of the Scotch Tours.


409. _Cave of Staffa_. [XXIX.]

The reader may be tempted to exclaim, 'How came this and the two
following Sonnets to be written, after the dissatisfaction expressed in
the preceding one?' In fact, at the risk of incurring the reasonable
displeasure of the master of the steamboat, I returned to the cave, and
explored it under circumstances more favourable to those imaginative
impressions which it is so wonderfully fitted to make upon the mind.


410. _Ox-eyed Daisy_.

    'Hope smiled when your nativity was cast,
    Children of summer!' (XXXI. ll. 1-2.)

Upon the head of the columns which form the front of the cave, rests a
body of decomposed basaltic matter, which was richly decorated with that
large bright flower, the ox-eyed daisy. I had noticed the same flower
growing with profusion among the bold rocks on the western coast of the
Isle of Man; making a brilliant contrast with their black and gloomy
surfaces.


411. _Iona_. [XXXIII.]

The four last lines of this Sonnet are adapted from a well-known Sonnet
of Russel, as conveying my feeling better than any words of my own could
do.


412. _River Eden_, [XXXVIII.]

    'Yet fetched from Paradise.'

It is to be feared that there is more of the poet than the sound
etymologist in this derivation of the name Eden. On the western coast of
Cumberland is a rivulet which enters the sea at Moresby, known also in
the neighbourhood by the name of Eden. May not the latter syllable come
from the word Dean, _a valley_? Langdale, near Ambleside, is by the
inhabitants called Langden. The former syllable occurs in the name
Emont, a principal feeder of the Eden; and the stream which flows, when
the tide is out, over Cartmel Sands, is called the Ea--eau,
French--aqua, Latin.


413. _Ibid._

    'Nature gives thee flowers that have no rival amidst British bowers.'

This can scarcely be true to the letter; but without stretching the
point at all, I can say that the soil and air appear more congenial with
many upon the bank of this river than I have observed in any other parts
of Great Britain.


414. *_Monument of Mrs. Howard_. [XXXIX.]

Before this monument was put up in the chapel at Wetheral, I saw it in
the sculptor's studio. Nollekens, who, by the bye, was a strange and
grotesque figure that interfered much with one's admiration of his
works, showed me at the same time the various models in clay which he
had made one after another of the mother and her infant. The improvement
on each was surprising, and how so much grace, beauty, and tenderness
had come out of such a head I was sadly puzzled to conceive. Upon a
window-seat in his parlour lay two casts of faces; one of the Duchess of
Devonshire, so noted in her day, and the other of Mr. Pitt, taken after
his death--a ghastly resemblance, as these things always are, even when
taken from the living subject, and more ghastly in this instance (of Mr.
Pitt) from the peculiarity of the features. The heedless and apparently
neglectful manner in which the faces of these two persons were left--the
one so distinguished in London society, and the other upon whose
counsels and public conduct during a most momentous period depended the
fate of this great empire, and, perhaps, of all Europe--afforded a
lesson to which the dullest of casual visitors could scarcely be
insensible. It touched me the more because I had so often seen Mr. Pitt
upon his own ground at Cambridge and upon the floor of the House of
Commons.


415. _Nunnery_. [XLI.]

I became acquainted with the walks of Nunnery when a boy. They are
within easy reach of a day's pleasant excursion from the town of
Penrith, where I used to pass my summer holidays under the roof of my
maternal grandfather. The place is well worth visiting, tho' within
these few years its privacy, and therefore the pleasure which the scene
is so well fitted to give, has been injuriously affected by walks cut in
the rocks on that side the stream which had been left in its natural
state.


416. _Scene at Corby_. [XLII.]

    'Canal, and Viaduct, and Railway tell!'

At Corby, a few miles below Nunnery, the Eden is crossed by a
magnificent viaduct; and another of these works is thrown over a deep
glen or ravine at a very short distance from the main stream.


417. *_Druidical Monument_. [XLIII.]

    'A weight of awe not easy to be borne.'

The daughters of Long Meg, placed in a perfect circle eighty yards in
diameter, are seventy-two in number above ground; a little way out of
the circle stands Long Meg herself, a single stone, eighteen feet high.
When I first saw this monument, as I came upon it by surprise, I might
over-rate its importance as an object; but, though it will not bear a
comparison with Stonehenge, I must say, I have not seen any other
relique of those dark ages, which can pretend to rival it in singularity
and dignity of appearance.


418. *_Lowther_. [XLIV.]

    'Cathedral pomp.'

It may be questioned whether this union was in the contemplation of the
Artist when he planned the edifice. However this might be, a Poet may be
excused for taking the view of the subject presented in this Sonnet.


419. _To the Earl of Lonsdale_. [XLV.]

This sonnet was written immediately after certain trials, which took
place at the Cumberland Assizes, when the Earl of Lonsdale, in
consequence of repeated and long-continued attacks upon his character,
through the local press, had thought it right to prosecute the
conductors and proprietors of three several journals. A verdict of libel
was given in one case; and, in the others, the prosecutions were
withdrawn, upon the individuals retracting and disavowing the charges,
expressing regret that they had been made, and promising to abstain from
the like in future.


420. *_The Somnambulist_. [XLVI.]

This poem might be dedicated to my friend Sir G. Beaumont and Mr. Rogers
jointly. While we were making an excursion together in this part of the
Lake District, we heard that Mr. Glover the artist, while lodging at
Lyulph's Tower, had been disturbed by a loud shriek, and upon rising he
learnt that it had come from a young woman in the house who was in the
habit of walking in her sleep. In that state she had gone down stairs,
and while attempting to open the outer door, either from some
difficulty, or the effect of the cold stone upon her feet, had uttered
the cry which alarmed him. It seemed to us all that this might serve as
a hint for a poem, and the story here told was constructed, and soon
after put into verse by me as it now stands.

[Note.--'Lyulph's Tower'--A pleasure-house built by the late Duke of
Norfolk upon the banks of Ullswater. Force is the word used in the Lake
District for Waterfall.]




XVIII. POEMS OF SENTIMENT AND REFLECTION.


421. _Expostulation and Reply_. [I.]

This poem is a favourite among the Quakers, as I have learnt on many
occasions. It was composed in front of the house at Alfoxden, in the
spring of 1798.


422. _The Tables turned_. [II.]

Composed at the same time [as Expostulation and Reply].


423. *_Lines written in early Spring_. [III.]

1798. Actually composed while I was sitting by the side of the brook
that runs down from the _Comb_, in which stands the village of Alford,
through the grounds of Alfoxden. It was a chosen resort of mine. The
brook fell down a sloping rock, so as to make a waterfall, considerable
for that country; and, across the pool below, had fallen a tree, an ash,
if I rightly remember, from which rose, perpendicularly, boughs in
search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above. The boughs bore
leaves of green, that for want of sunshine had faded into almost
lily-white; and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge
depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy, which waved gently in the
breeze, that might, poetically speaking, be called the breath of the
waterfall. This motion varied, of course, in proportion to the power of
water in the brook. When, with dear friends, I revisited this spot,
after an interval of more than forty years, this interesting feature of
the scene was gone. To the owner of the place I could not but regret
that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not tempted him
to make it more accessible, by a path, not broad or obtrusive, but
sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep along without
difficulty.
