ACT THREE SCENE THREE

Enter King, Queen, Malateste, Valasco, Lopez, [Roderigo and guards].

KING
The presence door be guarded, let none enter
On forfeit of your lives, without our knowledge.
Oh you are false physicians all unto me,
You bring me poison, but no antidotes.

QUEEN
Yourself that poison brews.

KING
Prithee, no more.

QUEEN
I will, I must speak more.

KING
Thunder aloud.

QUEEN
My child, yet newly quickened in my womb,
Is blasted with the fires of bastardy.

KING
Who! Who dares once but think so in his dream?

MALATESTE
Medina's faction preached it openly.

KING
Be cursed he and his faction. Oh how I labour
For these preventions! But so cross is fate
My ills are ne'r hid from me, but their cures.
What's to be done?

QUEEN
That which being left undone,
Your life lies at the stake. Let them be breathless
Both brat and mother.

KING
Ha!

MALATESTE
She plays true music Sir.
The mischiefs you are drenched in are so full,
You need not fear to add to them. Since now
No way is left to guard thy rest secure,
But by a means like this.

LOPEZ
All Spain rings forth
Medina's name, and his confederates.

RODRIGO
All his allies and friends rush into troops
Like raging torrents.

VALESCO
And loud trumpet forth
Your perjuries. Seducing the wild people,
And with rebellious faces threatening all.

KING
I shall be massacred in this their spleen,
Ere I have time to guard myself. I feel
The fire already falling. Where's our guard?

MALATESTE
Planted at guarded gate, with a strict charge
That none shall enter but by your command.

KING
Let them be doubled. I am full of thoughts,
A thousand wheels toss my incertain fears,
There is a storm in my hot boiling brains,
Which rises without wind. A horrid one.
What clamour's that?

QUEEN
Some treason. Guard the King.

Enter Balthazar drawn, [he strikes] one of the guards who falls.

BALTHAZAR
Not in?

MALATESTE
One of the guards is slain, keep off the murderer.

BALTHAZAR
I am none, sir.

VALASCO
There's a man dropped down by thee.

KING
Thou desperate fellow, thus press in upon us!
Is murder all the story we shall read?
What King can stand, when thus his subjects bleed?
What has thou done?

BALTHAZAR
No hurt.

KING
Played even the wolf,
And from a fold committed to my charge,
Stolen and devoured one of the flock.

BALTHAZAR
You have sheep enough for all that, Sir. I have killed none though.
Or if I have, mine <30> own blood, shed in your quarrels, may beg my
pardon. My business was in haste to you.

KING
I would not have thy sin scored on my head
For all the Indian Treasury. I prithee tell me,
Suppose thou had'st our pardon, oh can that cure
Thy wounded conscience, can there my pardon help thee?
Yet having deserved well both of Spain and us,
We will not pay thy worth with loss of life,
But banish thee for ever.

BALTHAZAR
For a groom's death?

KING
No more. We banish thee our court and Kingdom.
A King that fosters men so dipped in blood,
May be called merciful, but never good.
Be gone upon thy life.

BALTHAZAR
Well, farewell.

Exit Balthazar.

VALASCO
The fellow is not dead, but wounded sir.

QUEEN
After him Malateste. In our lodging
Stay that rough fellow, he's the man shall do't.
Haste or my hopes are lost.

Exit Malateste.

Why are you sad, sir?

KING
For thee, Paulina, swell my troubled thoughts
Like billows beaten by two warring winds.

QUEEN
Be you ruled but ruled by me, I'll make a calm
Smooth as the breast of heaven.

KING
Instruct me how.

QUEEN
You, as your fortunes tie you, are inclined
To have the blow given.

KING
Where's the instrument?

QUEEN
'Tis found in Balthazar.

KING
He's banished.

QUEEN
True
But stayed by me for this.

KING
His spirit is hot
And rugged, but so honest that his soul
Will never turn devil to do it.

QUEEN
Put it to trial.
Retire a little, hither I'll send for him,
Offer repeal and favours if he do it.
But if he deny, you have no finger in't,
And then his doom of banishment stands good.

KING
Be happy in thy workings, I obey.

Exit King

QUEEN
Stay Lopez.

LOPEZ
Madam.

QUEEN
Step to our lodging, Lopez
And instantly bid Malateste bring
The banished Balthazar to us.

LOPEZ
I shall.

Exit Lopez.

QUEEN
Thrive my black plots, the mischiefs I have set
Must not so die. Ills must new ills beget.

Enter Malateste and Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
Now! What hot poisoned custard must I put my spoon into now?

QUEEN
None, for mine honour is now thy protection.

MALATESTE
Which, noble soldier, she will pawn for thee
But never forfeit.

BALTHAZAR
'Tis a fair gage <31>, keep it.

QUEEN
Oh Balthazar! I am thy friend, and marked thee.
When the King sentenced thee to banishment
Fire sparkled from thine eyes of rage and grief.
Rage to be doomed so for a groom so base,
And grief to lose thy Country. Thou hast killed none,
The milk-sop is but wounded, thou are not banished.

BALTHAZAR
If I were, I lose nothing, I can make any country mine. I have a
private coat for Italian Stilettos, I can be treacherous with the
Walloon, drunk with the Dutch, a chimney-sweeper with the Irish, a
gentleman with the Welsh and true arrant thief with the English. What
then is my country to me?

QUEEN
The King, who rap'd with fury, banished thee,
Shall give thee favours, yield but to destroy
What him distempers.

BALTHAZAR
So. And what is the dish I must dress?

QUEEN
Only the cutting off a pair of lives.

BALTHAZAR
I love no red-wine healths.

QUEEN
The King commands it, you are but executioner.

BALTHAZAR
The hang-man? An office that will hold so long as hemp lasts. Why do
not you beg the office, Sir?

QUEEN
Thy victories in field never did crown thee
As this one Act shall.

BALTHAZAR
Prove but that, 'tis done.

QUEEN
Follow him close, he's yielding.

MALATESTE
Thou shalt be called thy Country's Patriot,
For quenching out a fire now newly kindling
In factious bosoms, and shalt thereby save
More Noble Spaniards lives, than thou slew Moors.

QUEEN
Art thou yet converted?

BALTHAZAR
No point.

QUEEN
Read me then:
Medina's niece, by a contract from the King,
Lays claim to all that's mine, my crown, my bed.
A son she has by him must fill the throne,
If her great faction can but work that wonder.
Now hear me...

BALTHAZAR
I do with gaping ears.

QUEEN
I swell with hopeful issue to the King.

BALTHAZAR
A brave Don call you mother.

MALATESTE
Of this danger the fear afflicts the King.

BALATAZAR
Cannot much blame him.

QUEEN
If therefore by the riddance of this Dame ...

BALTHAZAR
Riddance? Oh! The meaning on't is murder.

MALATESTE
Stab her, or so, that's all.

QUEEN
That Spain be free from frights, the King from fears,
And I, now held his infamy, be called Queen,
The treasure of the Kingdom shall lie open
To pay thy noble darings.

BALTHAZAR
Come. I'll do it, provided I hear Jove call to me, though he roars. I
must have the King's hand to this warrant, else I dare not serve it
upon my conscience.

QUEEN
Be firm then. Behold the King is come.

Enter King.

BALTHAZAR
Acquaint him.

QUEEN
I found the metal hard, but with oft beating
He's now so softened, he shall take impression
From any seal you give him.

KING
Balthazar,
Come hither, listen. Whatsoe'er our Queen
Has importuned thee to touching Onaelia
Niece to the Constable, and her young son,
My voice shall second it, and sign her promise.

BALTHAZAR
Their riddance?

KING
That.

BALTHAZAR
What way? By poison?

KING
So.

BALTHAZAR
Starving? Or strangling, stabbing, smothering?

QUEEN
Good.

KING
Any way, so 'tis done.

BALTHAZAR
But I will have, Sir,
This under your own hand, that you desire it,
You plot it, set me on to't.

KING
Pen, ink and paper.

[King writes and signs document.]

BALTHAZAR
And then as large a pardon as law and wit can engross for me.

KING
Thou shalt have my pardon.

BALTHAZAR
A word more, Sir, pray will you tell me one thing?

KING
Yes, any thing dear Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
Suppose I have your strongest pardon, can that cure my wounded
conscience? Can there your pardon help me? You not only knock the ewe
on the head, but cut the innocent lamb's throat too, yet you are no
butcher.

QUEEN
Is this thy promised yielding to an act
So wholesome for thy country?

KING
Chide him not.

BALTHAZAR
I would not have this sin scored on my head
For all the Indian Treasury.

KING
That song no more.
Do this and I will make thee a great man.

BALTHAZAR
Is there no farther trick in't but my blow, your purse and my pardon?

MALTATESTE
No nets upon my life to entrap thee.

BALTHAZAR
Then trust me. These knuckles work it.

KING
Farewell. Be confident and sudden.

BALTHAZAR
Yes.
Subjects may stumble, when kings walk astray.
Thine Acts shall be a new Apocrypha.

Exeunt.

ACT FOUR SCENE ONE

Enter Medina, Alba, [Carlo], and Daenia, met by Balthazar with a
poniard and a pistol.

BALTHAZAR
You met a Hydra. See, if one head fails
Another with a sulphurous beak stands yawning.

MEDINA
What hath raised up this devil?

BALTHAZAR
A great man's vices, that can raise all hell. What would you call
that man, who under-sail in a most goodly ship, wherein he ventures
his life, fortunes, and honours, yet in a fury should hew the mast
down, cast sails overboard, fire all the tacklings, and to crown this
madness, should blow up all the decks, burn th'oaken ribs, and in
that combat 'twix two elements leap desperately, and drown himself in
the seas? What were so brave a fellow?

ALL
A brave black villain.

BALTHAZAR
That's I. All that brave black villain dwells in me, if I be that
black villain. But I am not! A nobler character prints out my brow,
which you may thus read, I was banished Spain for emptying a court-
hogshead, but repealed so I would, ere my reeking iron was cold,
promise to give it a deep crimson dye in - none hear, - stay - no,
none hear.

MEDINA
Whom then?

BALTHAZAR
Basely to stab a woman, your wronged niece and her most innocent son,
Sebastian.

ALBA
The boar now foams with wetting.

DAENIA
What has blunted
Thy weapons point at these?

BALTHAZAR
My honesty. A sign at which few dwell, pure honesty! I am a vassal to
Medina's house, He taught me first the A-B-C of war. E'er I was
truncheon high, I had the stile on beardless Captain, writing then
but boy, and shall I now turn slave to him that fed me with Cannon-
bullets and taught me, ostrich-like to digest iron and steel! No! Yet
I yielded with willow-bendings to commanding breaths.

MEDINA
Of whom?

BALTHAZAR
Of King and Queen. With supple hams and an ill-boding look, I vowed
to do it. Yet, lest some choke-pear <32> of state policy should stop
my throat, and spoil my drinking pipe, see, like his cloak, I hung at
the King's elbow, till I had got his hand to sign my life.

[Balthazar passes over the document signed by the King.]

DAENIA
Shall we see this and sleep?

ALBA
No, whilst these wake.

MEDINA
'Tis the King's hand?

BALTHAZAR
Think you me a coiner <33>?

MEDINA
No, no,
Thou art thy self still, noble Balthazar.
I ever knew thee honest, and the mark
Stands still upon thy forehead.

BALTHAZAR
Else flea the skin off.

MEDINA
I ever knew thee valiant, and to scorn
All acts of baseness. I have seen this man
Write in the field such stories with his sword,
That our best chieftains swore there was in him
As 'twere a new philosophy of fighting,
His deeds were so punctilious. In one battle
When death so nearly missed my ribs, he struck
Three horses stone-dead under me. This man,
Three times that day, even through the jaws of danger,
Redeemed me up and, I shall print it ever,
Stood over my body with Colossus thighs
Whilst all the thunder-bolts which war could throw,
Fell on his head. And Balthazar, thou canst not
Be now but honest still, and valiant still,
Not to kill boys and women.

BALTHAZAR
My biter here, eats no such meat.

MEDINA
Go fetch the marked-out lamb for slaughter hither,
Good fellow-soldier aid him, and stay, mark,
Give this false fire to the believing King,
That the child's sent to heaven, but that the mother
Stands rocked so strong with friends, ten thousand billows
Cannot once shake her.

BALTHAZAR
This I'll do.

MEDINA
Away.
Yet one word more. Your counsel, Noble friends.
Hark Balthazar, because nor eyes nor tongues,
Shall by loud larums, that the poor boy lives,
Question thy false report, the child shall, closely
Mantled in darkness, forthwith be conveyed
To the monastery of Saint Paul.

ALL
Good.

MEDINA
Despatch then, be quick.

BALTHAZAR
As lightning.

Exit Balthazar.

ALBA
This fellow is some angel dropped from heaven
To preserve innocence.

MEDINA
He is a wheel
Of swift and turbulent motion. I have trusted him,
Yet will not hang on him too many plummets,
Lest with a headlong gyre <34> he ruins all.
In these state consternations, when a kingdom
Stands tottering at the centre, out of suspicion
Safety grows often. Let us suspect this fellow,
And that albeit he show us the King's hand,
It may be but a trick.

DAENIA
Your Lordship hits
A poisoned nail i'th head. This waxen fellow,
By the King's hand so bribing him with gold,
Is set on screws, perhaps is made his creature,
To turn round every way.

MEDINA
Out of that fear
Will I beget truth. For myself in person
Will sound the King's breast.

CARLO
How? Yourself in person?

ALBA
That's half the prize he gapes for.

MEDINA
I'll venture it,
And come off well I warrant you, and rip up
His very entrails, cut in two his heart,
And search each corner in't, yet shall not he
Know who it is cut up the anatomy.

DAENIA
'Tis an exploit worth wonder.

CARLO
Put the worst,
Say some infernal voice should roar from hell,
The infant's cloistering up.

ALBA
'Tis not our danger,
Nor the imprisoned Prince's, for what thief
Dares by base sacrilege rob the Church of him?

CARLO
At worst none can be lost but this slight fellow!

MEDINA
All build on this as on a stable cube.
If we our footing keep, we fetch him forth,
And crown him King. If up we fly i'th air,
We for his soul's health a broad way prepare.

DAENIS
They come.

Enter Balthazar and Sebastian.

MEDINA
Thou knowest where to bestow him, Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
Come noble boy.

ALBA
Hide him from being discovered.

BALTHAZAR
Discovered? Would there stood a troop of Moors thrusting the paws of
hungry lions forth, to seize this prey, and this but in my hand, I
should do something.

SEBASTIAN
Must I go with this black fellow, Uncle?

MEDINA
Yes, pretty coz, hence with him Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
Sweet child, within few minutes I'll change thy fate
And take thee hence, but set thee at heavens gate.

[Exit Balthazar and Sebastian.]

MEDINA
Some keep aloof and watch this soldier

CARLO
I'll do't.

Exit Carlo.

DAENIA
What's to be done now?

MEDINA
First to plant strong guard
About the mother, then into some snare
To hunt this spotted panther, and there kill him.

DAENIA
What snares have we can hold him?

MEDINA
Be that care mine.
Dangers, like stars, in dark attempts best shine.

Exeunt.

ACT FOUR SCENE TWO

Enter Cornego, Balthazar.

CORNEGO
The Lady Onaelia dresseth the stead of her commendations in the most
courtly attire that words can be clothed with, from herself to you,
by me.

BALTHAZAR
So Sir, and what disease troubles her now?

CORNEGO
The King's evil. And here she hath sent something to you, wrapped up
in a white sheet, you need not fear to open it, 'tis no course.

BALTHAZAR
What's here? A letter minced into five morsels? What was she doing
when thou camest from her?

CORNEGO
At her prick-song.

BALTHAZAR
So me thinks, for here's nothing but sol-re-me-fa-mi. What crotchet
fills her head now, canst tell?

CORNEGO
No crotchets, 'tis only the Cliff has made her mad.

BALTHAZAR
What instrument played she upon?

CORNEGO
A wind instrument, she did nothing but sigh.

BALTHAZAR
Sol, re, me, fa, mi.

CORNEGO
My wit has always a singing head, I have found out her note captain.

BALTHAZAR
The tune? Come.

CORNEGO
Sol, my soul. Re, is all rent and torn like a ragamuffin. Me, mend it
good captain. Fa, fa. What's fa Captain?

BALTHAZAR
Fa, why farewell and be hanged.

CORNEGO
Mi Captain, with all my heart. Have I tickled my Lady's fiddle well?

BALTHAZAR
Oh, but you stick wants rosin <35> to make the strings sound clearly.
No, this double virginal, being cunningly touched, another matter of
jack leaps up then is now in mine eye. Sol, re me fa, mi, I have it
now. Solus Rex me facit miseram <36>. Alas poor Lady, tell her no
apothecary in Spain has any of that assa foetida <37 > she writes
for.

CORNEGO
Assa foetida? What's that?

BALTHAZARA
A thing to be taken in a glister-pipe <38>.

CORNEGO
Why, what ails my Lady?

BALTHAZAR
What ails she? Why when she cries out, Solus Rex me facit miseram,
she says in the Hypocronicall <39> language, that she is so miserably
tormented with the wind colic that it racks her very soul.

CORNEGO
I said somewhat cut her soul in pieces.

BALTHAZAR
But go to her, and say the oven is heating.

CORNEGO
And what shall be baked in't?

BALTHAZAR
Carp pies.<40> And besides, tell her the hole in her coat shall be
mended, and tell her if the dial of good days <41> goes true, why
then bounce buckrum.<42>

CORNEGO
The devil lies sick of the mulligrubs.<43>

BALTHAZAR
Or the Cony is dub'd, and three sheepskins ...

CORNEGO
With the wrong side outward ...

BALTHAZAR
Shall make the fox a night-cap.

CORNEGO
So the goose talks French to the buzzard.

BALTHAZAR
But, Sir, if evil days jostle our prognostication to the wall, then
say there's a fire in a whore-masters cod-piece.

CORNEGO
And a poisoned bag-pudding in Tom Thumb's belly.

BALTHAZAR
The first cut be thine. Farewell.

CORNEGO
Is this all?

BALTHAZAR
Would'st not trust an Almanac?

CORNEGO
Not a coranta <44> neither, though it were sealed with butter, <45>
and yet I know where they both lie passing well.

Enter Lopez.

LOPEZ
The King sends round about the court to seek you.

BALTHAZAR
Away Otterhound.

CORNEGO
Dancing bear, I'm gone.

Exit Cornego. Enter King attended.

KING
A Private room,

Exeunt, King and Balthazar remain

I'st done? Hast drawn thy two-edged sword out yet?

BALTHAZAR
No, I was striking at the two iron bars that hinder your passage, and
see Sir.

Draws.

KING
What mean'st thou?

BALTHAZAR
The edge abated, feel.

KING
No, no I see it.

BALTHAZAR
As blunt as ignorance.

KING
How? Put up - so - how?

BALTHAZAR
I saw by chance hanging in Cardinal Alvarez gallery, a picture of
hell.

KING
So what of that?

BALTHAZAR
There lay upon burnt straw ten thousand brave fellows all stark
naked, some leaning upon crowns, some on Mitres, some on bags of
gold. Glory, in another corner lay, a feather beaten in the rain.
Beauty was turned into a watching candle that went out stinking.
Ambition went upon a huge high pair of stilts but horribly rotten.
Some in another nook were killing Kings, and some having their elbows
shoved forward by Kings to murder others. I was, me thought, half in
hell myself whist I stood to view this piece.

KING
Was this all?

BALTHAZAR
Was't not enough to see that a man is more healthful that eats dirty
puddings, than he that feeds on a corrupted conscience?

KING
Conscience! What's that? A conjuring book ne'r opened
Without the reader's danger. 'Tis indeed
A scarecrow set i'th world to frighten weak fools.
Hast thou seen fields paved o'er with carcasses,
Now to be tender-footed, not to tread
On a boy's mangled quarters, and a woman's!

BALTHAZAR
Nay, Sir, I have searched the records of the Low-Countries, and find
that by your pardon I need not care a pin for goblins, and therefore
I will do it Sir. I did recoil because I was double charged.

KING
No more. Here comes a satyr with sharp horns.

Enter Cardinal, and Medina like a French Doctor.

CARDINAL
Sir, here's a Frenchman charged with some strange business
Which to close ear only he'll deliver,
Or else to none.

KING
A Frenchman?

MEDINA
Oui, Monsieur.

KING
Cannot he speak the Spanish?

MEDINA
Si Signor, un Poco - Monsieur Acontez in de Corner, me come for offer
to your Bon Grace mi trezhumbla service, by gar no John fidleco shall
put into your near braver melody dan dis un petite pipe shall play to
your great bon Grace.

KING
What is the tune you strike up, touch the string.

MEDINA
Dis - me has run up and down mine Country and learn many fine thing,
and mush knavery, now more and all dis me know you'll jumbla de fine
vench and fill her belly with garsoone, her name is La Madam ...

KING
Onaelia.

MEDINA
She by gar. Now Monsieur dis Madam send for me to help her malady,
being very naught of her corpus, her body, me know you no point loves
dis vench. But royal Monsieur donne moye ten thousand French Crowns
she shall kick up her tail by gar, and beshide lie dead as dog in de
shannell.

KING
Speak low.

MEDINA
As de bag-pipe when de wind is puff, Gar beigh,

KING
Thou namest ten thousand Crowns, I'll treble them
Rid me of this leprosy. Thy name?

MEDINA
Monsieur Doctor Devil.

KING
Shall I a second wheel add to this mischief
To set it faster going? If one break,
T'other may keep his motion.

MEDINA
Esselent fort boone.

KING
Balthazar.
To give thy sword an edge again, this Frenchman
Shall whet thee on, that if thy pistol fail,
Or poniard, this can send the poison home.

BALTHAZAR
Brother Cain we'll shake hands.

MEDINA
In de bowl of de bloody busher. 'Tis very fine wholesome.

KING
And more to arm your resolution,
I'll tune this Churchman so, that he shall chime
In sounds harmonious, merit to that man
Whose hand has but a finger in that act.

BALTHAZAR
That music were worth hearing.

KING
Holy father,
You must give pardon to me in unlocking
A cave stuffed full with serpents, which my State
Threaten to poison, and it lies in you
To break their bed with thunder of your voice.

CARDINAL
How princely son?

KING
Suppose a universal
Hot pestilence beat her mortiferous wings
O'er all my kingdoms, am I not bound in soul,
To empty all our academies of doctors
And Aesculapian <46> spirits to charm this plague?

CARDINAL
You are.

KING
Or had the canon made a breach
Into our rich Escurial <47>, down to beat it
About our ears, should I stop this breach
Spare even our richest Ornaments, nay our crown,
Could it keep bullets off.

CARDINAL
No sir, you should not.

KING
This linstock <48> gives you fire. Shall then that strumpet
And bastard breathe quick vengeance in my face,
Making my Kingdom reel, my subjects stagger
In their obedience, and yet live?

CARDINAL
How? Live!
Shed not their bloods to gain a kingdom greater
Than ten times this.

MEDINA
Pish, not matter how Red-cap and his wit run.

KING
As I am Catholic King, I'll have their hearts
Panting in these two hands.

CARDINAL
Dare you turn hangman?
Is this religion Catholic to kill
What even brute beasts abhor to do, your own!
To cut in sunder wedlock's sacred knot
Tied by heaven's fingers! To make Spain a bonfire
To quench which must a second deluge rain
In showers of blood, no water. If you do this
There is an arm armipotent that can fling you
Into a base grave, and your palaces
With lightening strike, and of their ruins make
A tomb for you, unpitied and abhorred,
Bear witness all you lamps celestial
I wash my hands of this.

KING
Rise my good angel,
Whose holy tunes beat from me that evil spirit
Which jogs mine elbow, hence thou dog of hell.

MEDINA
Bow wow.

KING
Bark out no more thou mastiff, get you all gone,
And let my soul sleep. [Aside to Balthazar] There's gold, peace, see
it done.

Exit King.

BALTHAZAR
Sirra, you salsa-perilla <49>, rascal, toads-gut, you whorson pockey
French spawn of a butsten-bellyed spider. Do you hear Monsieur?

MEDINA
Why do you bark and snap at my Narcissus, as if I were de French dog?

BALTHAZAR
You cur of Cerberus litter,

[Strikes him]

You'll poison the honest Lady? Do but once toot <50> into her
chamber-pot, and I'll make thee look worse than a witch does upon a
close stool.

CARDINAL
You shall not dare to touch him, stood he here
Single before thee.

BALTHAZAR
I'll cut the rat into anchovies.

CARDINAL
I'll make thee kiss his hand, embrace him, love him
And call him ...

Medina [reveals his true identity].

BALTHAZAR
The perfection of all Spaniards, Mars in little, the best book of the
art of war printed in these times. As a French doctor, I would have
given you pellets for pills, but as my noblest Lord, rip my heart out
in your service.

MEDINA
Thou are the truest Clock
That e'er to time paidst tribute, honest soldier,
I lost mine own shape, and put on a French
Only to try thy truth, and the King's falsehood,
Both which I find. Now this great Spanish volume
Is opened to me, I read him o'er and o'er,
Oh what black characters are printed in him.

CARDINAL
Nothing but certain ruin threats your niece,
Without prevention. Well this plot was laid
In such disguise to sound him, they that know
How to meet dangers, are the less afraid.
Yet let me counsel you not to text down
These wrongs in red lines.

MEDINA
No, I will not, father.
Now that I have anatomised his thoughts,
I'll read a lecture on them that shall save
Many men's lives, and to the kingdom minister
Most wholesome surgery. Here's our aphorism.
These letters from us in our niece's name,
You know treat of a marriage.

CARDINAL
There's the strong anchor
To stay all in this tempest.

MEDINA
Holy sir,
With these works you the King, and so prevail
That all these mischiefs hull <51> with flagging sail.

CARDINAL
My best in this I'll do.

MEDINA
Soldier, thy breast
I must lock better things in.

BALTHAZAR
'Tis your chest,
With three good keys to keep it from opening an honest heart, a
daring hand, and a pocket which scorns money.

Exeunt.

ACT FIVE SCENE ONE

Enter King, Cardinal with letters, [Valesco and Lopez].

KING
Commend us to Medina, say his letters
Right pleasing are, and that, except himself
Nothing could be more welcome. Counsel him,
To blot the opinion out of factious numbers,
Only to have his ordinary train
Waiting upon him. For, to quit all fears
Upon his side of us, our very court
Shall even but dimly shine with some few Dons,
Freely to prove our longings great to peace.

CARDINAL
The Constable expects some pawn from you,
That in this fairy circle shall rise up
No fury to confound his niece nor him.

KING
A King's word is engaged.

CARDINAL
It shall be taken.

KING
Valasco, call the Captain of our Guard,
Bid him attend us instantly.

VALASCO
I shall.

Exit Valasco.

KING
Lopez come hither. See,
Letters from Duke Medina, both in the name
Of him and all his faction, offering peace,
And our old love, his niece Onaelia
In marriage with her free and fair consent
To Cockadillio, a Don of Spain.

LOPEZ
Will you refuse this?

KING
My crown as soon. They feel their sinewy plots
Belike to shrink i'the joints. And fearing ruin,
Have found this cement out to piece up all,
Which more endangers all.

LOPEZ
How sir? Endangers!

KING
Lions may hunted be into the snare,
But if they once break loose, woe be to him
That first seized on them. A poor prisoner scorns
To kiss his jailer. And shall a king be choked
With sweet-meats by false traitors! No, I will fawn
On them as they stroke me, till they are fast
But in this paw. And then...

LOPEZ
A brave revenge!
The Captain of your Guard.

Enter Alanzo, the Captain.

KING
Upon thy life
Double our guard this day. Let every man
Bear a charged pistol hid, and, at a watch-word
Given by a musket, when our self sees time,
Rush in, and, if Medina's faction wrestle
Against your forces, kill, but if yield, save.
Be secret!

ALANZO
I am charmed, Sir.

Exit Alanzo.

KING
Watch Valasco.
If any wear a Cross, feather or glove,
Or such prodigious signs of a knit faction,
Table their names up. At our court-gate plant
Good strength to bar them out, if once they swarm.
Do this upon thy life.

VALASCO
Not death shall fright me.

Exit [Valasco and Lopez,] enter Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
'Tis done, Sir.

KING
Death! What's Done?

BALTHAZAR
Young cub's flayed, but the she-fox shifting her hole is fled. The
little jackanapes, the boy's brained.

KING
Sebastian?

BALTHAZAR
He shall ne'r speak more Spanish.

KING
Thou teachest me to curse thee.

BALTHAZAR
For a bargain you set your hand to.

KING
Half my crown I'd lose were it undone.

BALTHAZAR
But half a crown! That's nothing.
His brains stick in my conscience more than yours.

KING
How lost I the French doctor?

BALTHAZAR
As Frenchmen lose their hair. Here was too hot staying for him.

KING
Get thou from my sight, the Queen would see thee.

BALTHAZAR
Your gold, Sir.

KING
Go with Judas and repent.

BALTHAZAR
So men hate whores after lust's heat is spent.
I'm gone, Sir.

KING
Tell me true, is he dead?

BALTHAZAR
Dead.

KING
No matter. 'Tis but morning of revenge,
The sunset shall be red and tragical.

Exit King.

BALTHAZAR
Sin is a raven croaking <52> her own fall.

Exit Balthazar.

ACT FIVE SCENE TWO

Enter Medina, Daenia, Alba, Carlo and The Faction with Rosemary <53>
in their hats.

MEDINA
Keep locked the door, and let none enter to us
But who shares our fortunes.

DAENIA
Lock the doors.

ALBA
What entertainment did the King bestow
Upon your letters and the Cardinal's?

MEDINA
With a devouring eye he read them o'er,
Swallowing our offers into his empty bosom,
As gladly as the parched earth drinks healths
Out of the cup of heaven.

CARLO
Little suspecting
What dangers closely lie enambushed.

DAENIA
Let us not trust to that. There's in his breast
Both fox and lion, and both these beasts can bite.
We must not now behold the narrowest loop-hole,
But presently suspect a winged bullet
Flies whizzing by our ears.

MEDINA
For when I let
The plummet fall to sound his very soul
In his close-chamber, being French-Doctor like,
He to the Cardinal's ear sung sorcerous notes,
The burden of his song, to mine, was death,
Onaelia's murder, and Sebastian's.
And think you his voice alters now? 'Tis strange,
To see how brave this tyrant shows in court,
Throned like a god. Great men are pretty stars,
When his rays shine, wonder fills up all eyes
By sight of him, let him but once check sin,
About him round all cry, oh excellent King!
Oh Saint-like man! But, let this King retire
Into his closet to put off his robes,
He like a player leaves his part too.
Open his breast, and with a sunbeam search it,
There's no such man. This King of gilded clay,
Within is ugliness, lust, treachery,
And a base soul, though reared Colossus-like.

Balthazar beats to come.

DAENIA
None till he speaks, and that we know his voice.
Who are you?

BALTHAZAR (within)
An honest house-keeper in Rosemary Lane <54> too, if you dwell in the
same parish.

MEDINA
Oh 'tis our honest soldier, give him entrance.

BALTHAZAR
Men show like coarses, for I meet few but are stuck with Rosemary.
Every one asked me who was married today, and I told them Adultery
and Repentance, and that Shame and a Hangman followed them to church.

MEDINA
There's but two parts to play, shame has done hers,
But execution must close up the scene,
And for that cause these sprigs are worn by all,
Bags of marriage, now of funeral,
For death this day turns courtier.

BALTHAZAR
Who must dance with him?

MEDINA
The King, and all that are our opposites.
That dart or this must fly into the court
Either to shoot this blazing star from Spain,
Or else so long to wrap him up in clouds,
Till all the fatal fires in him burn out,
Leaving his state and conscience clear from doubt
Of following uproars.

ALBA
Kill not, but surprise him.

CARLO
That's my voice still.

MEDINA
Thine, soldier?

BALTHAZAR
Oh, this colic of a kingdom, when the wind of treason gets amongst
the small guts, what a rumbling and a roaring it keeps. And yet, make
the best of it you can, it goes on stinking. Kill a King?

DAENIA
Why?

BALTHAZAR
If men should pull the sun out of heaven every time 'tis eclipsed,
not all the wax nor tallow in Spain would serve to make us candles
for one year.

MEDINA
No way to purge
The sick state, but by opening a vein.

BALTHAZAR
Is that your French physic? If every one of us should be whipped
according to our faults, to be lashed at a cart's tail would be held
but a flea biting.

Enter Signor No.

MEDINA  whispers
What are you? Come from the King?

NO
No.

BALTHAZAR
No? More no's? I know him, let him enter.

MEDINA
Signor, I thank your kind intelligence,
The news long since was sent into our ears,
Yet we embrace your love, so fare you well.

CARLO
Will you smell to a sprig of rosemary?

NO
No.

BALTHAZAR
Will you be hanged?

NO
No.

BALTHAZAR
This is either Signor No, or no Signor.

MEDINA
He makes his love to us a warning piece
To arm ourselves against we come to court,
Because the guard is doubled.

ALL
Tush, we care not.

BALTHAZAR
If any here arms his hand to cut off the head, let him first pluck
out my throat. In any noble act I'll wade chin-deep with you. But to
kill a King?

MEDINA
No hear me...

BALTHAZAR
You were better, my Lord, sail five hundred times to Bantam <55> in
the West Indies, that once to Barathrum in the Low Countries. It's
hot going under the line there, the calenture <56> of the soul is a
most miserable madness.

MEDINA
Turn then this wheel of fate from shedding blood
Till with her own hand Justice weighs all.

BALTHAZAR
Good.

Exeunt.

ACT FIVE SCENE THREE

Enter Queen, Malateste.

QUEEN
Must then his trul <57> be once more sphered in court
To triumph in my spoils, in my eclipses?
And I like moping Juno sit, whilst Jove
Varies his lust into five hundred shapes
To steal to his whore's bed! No Malateste,
Italian fires of Jealousy burn my marrow.
For to delude my hopes, the lecherous king
Cuts out this robe of cunning marriage,
To cover his incontinence, which flames
Hot, as my fury, in his black desires.
I am swollen big with child of vengeance now,
And till delivered, feel the throws of hell.

MALATESTE
Just is your imagination, high and noble,
And the brave heat of a true Florentine:
For Spain trumpets abroad her interest
In the King's heart, and with a black coal draws
On every wall your scoffed at injuries,
As one that has the refuse of her sheets,
And the sick Autumn of the weakened King,
Where she drunk pleasures up in the full spring.

QUEEN
That, Malateste, that, that torrent wracks me.
But Hymen's torch, held downward, shall drop out,
And for it, the mad Furies swing their brands
About the bride-chamber.

MALATESTE
The priest that joins them,
Our twin born malediction.

QUEEN
Loud it may speak.

MALATESTE
The herbs and flowers to strew the wedding way,
Be cypress, eugh, cold colliquintida. <58>

QUEEN
Herbane and poppy, and that magical weed
Which hags at midnight watch to catch the seed. <59>

MALATESTE
To these our execrations, and what mischief
Hell can but hatch in a distracted brain,
I'll be the executioner, though it look
So horrid it can fright even murder back.

QUEEN
Poison his whore today, for thou shalt wait
On the King's cup, and when heated with wine
He calls to drink the bride's health, marry her
Alive to a gaping grave.

MALATESTE
At board?

QUEEN
At board.

MALATESTE
When she being guarded round about with friends,
Like a fairy land, hemmed with rocks and seas,
What rescue shall I find?

QUEEN
Mine arms. Dost faint?
Stood all the Pyrenean hills that part
Spain and our country, on each others shoulders,
Burning with Aetnean flame, yet thou should'st on,
As being my steel of resolution,
First striking sparkles from my flinty breast.
Wert thou to catch the horses of the sun
Fast by their bridles, and to turn back day,
Would'st thou not do it, base coward, to make way
To the Italians second bliss, revenge?

MALATESTE
Were my bones threatened to the wheel of torture
I'll do it.

Enter Lopez.

QUEEN
A raven's voice, and it likes me well.

LOPEZ
The King expects your presence.

MALATESTE
So, so we come.
To turn this bride's day to a day of doom.

Exeunt.

ACT FIVE SCENE FOUR

A banquet set out, cornets sounding; enter at one door, Lopez,
Valasco, Alanzo, No. After them King, Cardinal, with Don Cockadillio,
Bridegroom, Queen and Malateste after. At the other door, Alba,
Carlo, Roderigo, Medina and Daenia leading Onaelia as bride, Cornego,
and Juanna after, Balthazar alone. The Bride and Bridegroom kiss, and
by the Cardinal are joined hand in hand. The King is very merry,
hugging Medina very lovingly.

KING
For half Spain's weigh in ingots I'd not lose
This little man today.

MEDINA
Not for so much
Twice told Sir, would I miss your Kingly presence.
Mine eyes have lost the acquaintance of your face
So long, and I so little late read o'er
That index of the royal book your mind,
That scarce, without your comment, can I tell
When in those leaves you turn o'er smiles or frowns.

KING
'Tis dimness of your sight, no fault i'the letter.
Medina, you shall find that free from erratas,
And for a proof, if I could breathe my heart
In welcome forth, this hall should ring naught else.
Welcome Medina, Good Marquis Daenia,
Dons of Spain all welcome.
My dearest love and Queen, be it your place
To entertain the bride, and do her grace.

QUEEN
With all the love I can, whose fire is such,
To give her heat, I cannot burn too much.

KING
Contracted bride, and bridegroom sit,
Sweet flowers not plucked in season lose their scent,
So will our pleasures. Father Cardinal,
Methinks this morning new begins our reign.

CARDINAL
Peace had her Sabbath ne'r till now in Spain.

KING
Where is our noble soldier Balthazar?
So close in conference with that Signor?

NO
No.

KING
What think'st thou of this great day Balthazar?

BALTHAZAR
Of this day? Why as of a new play, if it ends well, all's well. All
but men are but actors, now if you being the King should be out of
your part, or the Queen out of hers, or your Dons out if theirs,
here's No will never be out of his.

NO
No.

BALTHAZAR
'Twere a lamentable piece of stuff to see great statesmen have vile
exits, but I hope there are nothing but plaudities in all your eyes.

KING
Mine I protest are free.

QUEEN
And mine by heaven.

MALATESTE [Aside]
Free from one good look till the blow be given.

KING
Wine. A full cup crowned to Medina's health.

MEDINA
Your highness this day so much honours me,
That I to pay you what I truly owe,
My life shall venture for it.

DAENIA
So shall mine.

KING
Onaelia, you are sad. Why frowns your brow?

ONAELIA
A foolish memory of my past ills
Folds up my look in furrows of old care,
But my heart's merry, Sir.

KING
Which mirth to heighten,
Your bridegroom and yourself first pledge this health
Which we begin to our High Constable.

Three cups filled, one to the King, the second to the Bridegroom and
the third to Onaelia, with whom the King compliments.

QUEEN
Is't speeding?

MALATESTE
As all our Spanish figs are.

KING
Here's to Medina's heart with all my heart.

MEDINA
My heart shall pledge your heart i'th deepest draught
That ever Spaniard drank.

KING
Medina mocks me,
Because I wrong her with the largest bowl.
I'll change with thee Onaelia.

Malateste rages.

QUEEN
Sir, you shall not!

KING
Fear you I cannot fetch it off?

QUEEN
Malateste!

KING
This is your scorn to her, because I am doing
This poorest honour to her. Music sound,
It goes were it ten fathoms to the ground.

Cornets play. King drinks, Queen and Malateste storm.

MALATESTE
Fate strikes with the wrong weapon.

QUEEN
Sweet Royal Sir no more, it is too deep.

MALATESTE
Twill hurt your health sir.

KING
Interrupt me in my drink? 'Tis off.

MALATESTE
Alas Sir.
You have drunk your last, that poisoned bowl I filled
Not to be put in your hand, but hers.

KING
Poisoned?

ALL
Descend black speckled soul to hell!

[The faction turn on Malateste and wound him.]

MALATESTE
The Queen has sent me thither.

Malateste dies.

CARDINAL
What new fury shakes now with her snake's locks?

QUEN
I, I, 'tis I
Whose soul is torn in pieces, till I send
This harlot home.

CARDINAL
More murders! Save the Lady.

BALTHAZAR
Rampant? Let the Constable make a mittimus <60>.

MEDINA
Keep them asunder.

CARDINAL
How is it royal son?

KING
I feel no poison yet, only mine eyes
Are putting out their lights. Me thinks I feel
Death's icy fingers stroking down my face.
And now I'm in a mortal cold sweat.

QUEEN
Dear my Lord.

KING
Hence, call in my physicians.

MEDINA
Thy physician tyrant,
Dwells yonder, call on him or none.

KING
Bloody Medina, stab'st thou Brutus too?

DAENIA
As he is, so are we all.

KING
I burn,
My brains boil in a cauldron, oh one drop
Of water now to cool me.

ONAELIA
Oh, let him have physicians.

MEDINA
Keep her back.

KING
Physicians for my soul, I need none else.
You'll not deny me those. Oh holy father,
Is there no mercy hovering in a cloud
For me a miserable King so drenched
In perjury and murder?

CARDINAL
Oh Sir, great store.

KING
Come down, come quickly down.

CARDINAL
I'll forthwith send
For a grave Friar to be your confessor.

KING
Do, do.

CARDINAL
And he shall cure your wounded soul.
Fetch him good soldier.

BALTHAZAR
So good a work, I'll hasten.

[Exit Balthazar.]

KING
Onaelia! Oh she's drowned in tears! Onaelia,
Let me not die unpardoned at thy hands.

Enter Balthazar, Sebastian as a Friar with others.

CARDINAL
Here comes a better surgeon.

SEBASTIAN
Hail my good son
I come to be thy ghostly father.

KING
Ha?
My child! 'Tis my Sebastian, or some spirit
Sent in his shape to fright me.

BALTHAZAR
'Tis no goblin, Sir, feel. Your own flesh and blood, and much younger
than you though he be bald, and calls you son. Had I been as ready to
have cut his sheep's throat, as you were to send him to the shambles
<61>, he had bleated no more. There's less chalk upon your score of
sins by these round O'es <62>.

KING
Oh my dull soul look up, thou art somewhat lighter.
Noble Medina, see Sebastian lives.
Onaelia cease to weep, Sebastian lives.
Fetch me my crown. My sweetest pretty Friar
Can my hands do't, I'll raise thee one step higher.
Thou'st been in heaven's house all this while sweet boy?

SEBASTIAN
I had but coarse cheer.

KING
Thou could'st n'er fare better.
Religious houses are those hives where bees
Make honey for men's souls. I tell thee boy,
A Friary is a cube, which strongly stands,
Fashioned by men, supported by heaven's hands.
Orders of holy priesthood are as high
I'th eyes of Angels, as a King's dignity.
Both these unto a Crown give the full weight,
And both are thine. You that our contract know,
See how I seal it with this marriage.
My blessing and Spain's kingdom both be thine.

ALL
Long live Sebastian.

ONAELIA
Doff that Friar's coarse grey.
And since he's crowned a King, clothe him like one.

KING
Oh no. Those are right sovereign ornaments.
Had I been clothed so, I had never filled
Spain's chronicle with my black calumny.
My work is almost finished. Where's my Queen?

QUEEN
Here piecemeal, torn by Furies.

KING
Onaelia!
Your hand Paulina too, Onaelia yours.
This hand, the pledge of my twice broken faith,
By you usurped is her inheritance.
My love is turned, see as my fate is turned,
Thus they today laugh, yesterday which mourned.
I pardon thee my death. Let her be sent
Back into Florence with a trebled dowry.
Death comes, oh now I see what late I feared!
A contract broke, though pieced up ne'r so well,
Heaven sees, earth suffers, but it ends in hell.

King Dies.

ONAELIA
Oh, I could die with him.

QUEEN
Since the bright sphere
I moved in falls, alas what make I here?

Exit Queen.

MEDINA
The hammers of black mischief now cease beating,
Yet some irons still are heating. You Sir Bridegroom,
Set all this while up as a mark to shoot at,
We here discharge you of your bedfellow,
She loves no barber's washing <63>.

COCKADILLIO
My balls are saved then.

MEDINA
Be it your charge, so please you reverend Sir,
To see the late Queen safely to Florence.
My niece Onaelia, and that trusty soldier,
We do appoint to guard the infant King.
Other distractions, time must reconcile.
The State is poisoned like a crocodile.

FINIS
