AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS NASH.

It is mainly, no doubt, but I hope not exclusively, an antiquarian
interest which attaches to the name of Thomas Nash. It would be
absurd to claim for a writer so obscure a very prominent place in the
procession of Englishmen of letters. His works proclaim by their extreme
rarity the fact that three centuries of readers have existed cheerfully
and wholesomely without any acquaintance with their contents. At the
present moment, the number of those living persons who have actually
perused the works of Nash may probably be counted on the fingers of
two hands. Most of these productions are uncommon to excess, one or two
exist in positively unique examples. There is no use in arguing against
such a fact as this. If Nash had reached, or even approached, the
highest order of merit, he would have been placed, long ere this, within
the reach of all. Nevertheless, his merits, relative if not positive,
were great. In the violent coming of age of Elizabethan literature,
his voice was heard loudly, not always discordantly, and with an accent
eminently personal to himself. His life, though shadowy, has elements of
picturesqueness and pathos; his writings are a storehouse of oddity and
fantastic wit

It has been usual to class Nash with the Precursors of Shakespeare, and
until quite lately it was conjectured that he was older than Greene and
Peele, a contemporary of Lodge and Chapman. It is now known that he
was considerably younger than all these, and even than Marlowe and
Shakespeare. Thomas Nash, the fourth child of the Rev. William Nash, who
to have been curate of Lowestoft in Suffolk, was baptized in that
town in November, 1567. The Nashes continued to live in Lowestoft, where
the father died in 1603, probably three years after the death of his son
Thomas. Of the latter we hear nothing more until, in October, 1582, at
the age of fifteen, he matriculated as a sizar of St. John's College,
Cambridge. Cooper says that he was admitted a scholar on the Lady
Margaret's foundation in 1584. He remained at Cambridge, in unbroken
residence, until July, 1589, "seven year together, lacking a quarter,"
as he tells us positively in "Lenten Stuff."

Cambridge was the hotbed of all that was vivid and revolutionary in
literature at that moment, and Robert Greene was the centre of literary
Cambridge. When Nash arrived, Greene, who was seven years his senior,
was still in residence at his study in Clare Hall, having returned from
his travels in Italy and Spain, ready, in 1583, to take his degree as
master of arts. He was soon, however, to leave for London, and it is
unlikely that a boy of sixteen would be immediately admitted to
the society of those "lewd wags" who looked up to the already
distinguished Greene as to a master. But Greene, without doubt, made
frequent visits to his university, and on one of these was probably
formed that intimate friendship with Nash which lasted until near the
elder poet's death. Marlowe was at Corpus, then called Benet College,
during five years of Nash's residence, but it is by no means certain
that their acquaintance began so early. It is, indeed, in the highest
degree tantalizing that these writers, many of whom loved nothing better
than to talk about themselves, should have neglected to give us the
information which would precisely be most welcome to us. A dozen whole
"Anatomies of Absurdity" and "Supplications of Pierce Penniless"
might be eagerly exchanged for a few pages in which the literary life of
Cambridge from 1582 to 1589 should be frankly and definitely described.

It has been surmised that Nash was ejected from the university in 1587.
His enemy, Gabriel Harvey, who was extremely ill-informed, gives this
account of what occurred:--

"[At Cambridge], (being distracted of his wits) [Nash] fell into diverse
misdemeanours, which were the first steps that brought him to this
poor estate. As, namely, in his fresh-time, how he flourished in all
impudency towards scholars, and abuse to the townsmen; insomuch that to
this day the townsmen call every untoward scholar of whom there is great
hope, _a very Nash_. Then, being bachelor of arts, which by great labour
he got, to show afterwards that he was not unworthy of it, had a hand in
a show called _Terminus et non terminus_; for the which his partner in
it was expelled the college; but this foresaid Nash played in it (as I
suppose) the Varlet of Clubs.... Then suspecting himself that he should
be stayed for _egregie dunsus_, and not attain to the next degree, said
he had commenced enough, and so forsook Cambridge, being bachelor of the
third year."

But, even in this poor gossip, we find nothing about ejection. Nash's
extraordinary abuse of language is probably the cause of that report. In
1589, in prefacing his "Anatomy of Absurdity," he remarked:--

"What I have written proceeded not from the pen of vainglory, but from
the process of that pensiveness, which two summers since overtook me;
whose obscured cause, best known to every name of curse, hath compelled
my wit to wander abroad unregarded in this satirical disguise, and
counselled my content to dislodge his delight from traitors' eyes."

That the young gentleman meant something by these sentences, it is only
charitable to suppose; that he could have been intelligible, even to
his immediate contemporaries, is hardly to be believed. This "obscured
cause" has been taken to be, by some, his removal from the University,
and, by others, his entanglement with a young woman. It is perhaps
simpler to understand him to say that the ensuing pamphlet was written,
in consequence of an intellectual crisis, in 1587, when he was twenty
years of age.

At twenty-two, at all events, we find him in London, beginning his
career as a man of letters. His first separate publication seems to have
been the small quarto in black letter from which a quotation has just
been made. This composition, named an "Anatomy" in imitation of several
then recent popular treatises of a similar title, is only to be pardoned
on the supposition that it was a boyish manuscript prepared at college.
It is vilely written, in the preposterous Euphuism of the moment;
the style is founded on Lyly, the manner is the manner of Greene, and
Whetstone in his moral "Mirrors" and "Heptamerons" has supplied the
matter. The "absurdity" satirized in this jejune and tedious tract is
extravagant living of all kinds. The author attacks women with great
vehemence, but only in that temper which permitted the young Juvenals
of the hour to preach against wine and cards and stageplays with intense
zeal, while practising the worship of all these with equal ardour. "The
Anatomy of Absurdity" is a purely academic exercise, interesting only
because it shows, in the praise of Sidney and the passage in defence of
poetry, something of the intellectual aptitude of the youthful writer.

In the same year, and a little earlier, Nash published an address "to
the gentlemen students of both universities," as a preface to a romance
by Greene. Bibliographers describe a supposititious "Menaphon" of 1587,
which nobody has ever seen; even if such an edition existed, it is
certain that Nash's address was not prefixed to it, for the style
is greatly in advance of his boyish writing of that year. It is an
interesting document, enthusiastic and gay in a manner hardly to be met
with again in its author, and diversified with graceful praise of St
John's College, defence of good poetry, and wholesome ridicule of those
who were trying to introduce the "Thrasonical huffsnuff" style of which
Phaer and Stanihurst were the prophets.

Still in 1589, but later in the year, Nash is believed to have thrown
himself into that extraordinary clash of theological weapons which is
celebrated as the Martin Marprelate Controversy. As is well known, this
pamphlet war grew out of the passionate resentment felt by the Puritans
against the tyrannical acts of Whitgift and the Bishops. The actual
controversy has been traced back to a defence of the establishment of
the Church, by the Dean of Sarum, on the one hand, and a treatise by
John Penry the Puritan, on the other, both published in 1587. In 1588
followed the violent Puritan libel, called "Martin Marprelate," secretly
printed, and written, perhaps, by a lawyer named Barrow. Towards the
close of the dispute several of the literary wits dashed in upon the
prelatical side, and denounced the Martinists with exuberant high
spirits. Among these Nash was long thought to have held a very prominent
place, for the two most brilliant tracts of the entire controversy,
"Pap with an Hatchet," 1589, and "An Almond for a Parrot," 1590, were
confidently attributed to him. These are now, however, clearly perceived
to be the work of a much riper pen, that, namely, of Lyly.

It is probable that the four anonymous and privately printed tracts,
which Dr. Grosart has finally selected, do represent Nash's share in
the Marprelate Controversy, although in one of them, "Martin's Month's
Mind," I cannot say that I recognize his manner. The "Countercuff,"
published in August, 1589, from Gravesend, shows a great advance in
power. The academic Euphuism has been laid aside; images and trains of
thought are taken from life and experience instead of from books. In
"Pasquils Return," which belongs to October of the same year, the author
invents the happy word "Pruritans" to annoy his enemy, and speaks,
probably in his own name, but perhaps in that of Pasquil, of a visit
to Antwerp. "Martin's Month's Mind," which is a crazy piece of fustian,
belongs to December, 1589, while the fourth tract, "Pasquil's Apology,"
appeared so late as July, 1590. The smart and active pen which
skirmishes in these pamphlets adds nothing serious to the consideration
of the tragical controversy in which it so lightly took part. It amused
and trained Nash to write these satires, but they left Udall none the
worse and the Bishops none the better. The author repeatedly promises to
rehearse the arguments on both sides and sum up the entire controversy
in a "May-Game of Martinism," of which we hear no more.

During the first twelve months of Nash's residence in London he
was pretty busily employed. It is just conceivable that six small
publications may have brought in money enough to support him. But after
this we perceive no obvious source of income for some considerable
time. How the son of a poor Suffolk minister contrived to live in
London throughout the years 1590 and 1591, it is difficult to imagine.
Certainly not on the proceeds of a single pamphlet. It is not credible
that Nash published much that has not come down to us. Perhaps a tract
here and there may have been lost.{1} He probably subsisted by hanging
on to the outskirts of education. Perhaps he taught pupils, more likely
still he wrote letters. We know, afterall, too little of the manners of
the age to venture on a reply to the question which constantly imposes
itself, How did the minor Elizabethan man of letters earn a livelihood?
In the case of Nash, I would hazard the conjecture, which is borne out,
I think, by several allusions in his writings, that he was a reader to
the press, connected, perhaps, with the Queen's printers, or with those
under the special protection of the Bishops.

     1 One long narrative poem, the very name of which is too
     coarse to quote, was, according to Oldys, certainly
     published; but of this no printed copy is known to exist.
     John Davies of Hereford says that "good men tore that
     pamphlet to pieces." I owe to the kindness of Mr. A. H.
     Bullen the inspection of a transtript of a very corrupt
     manuscript of this work.

His only production in 1591, so far as we know, was the insignificant
tract called "A Wonderful Astrological Prognostication," by "Adam
Fouleweather." This has been hastily treated as a defence of "the
dishonoured memory" of Nash's dead friend Greene against Gabriel
Harvey. But Greene did not die till the end of 1592, and in the
"Prognostication" there is nothing about either Greene or Harvey. The
pamphlet is a quizzical satire on the almanac-makers, very much in the
spirit of Swift's Bickerstaff "Predictions" a hundred years later.
Of more importance was a preface contributed in this same year to Sir
Philip Sidney's posthumous "Astrophel and Stella." In this short essay
Nash reaches a higher level of eloquence than he had yet achieved, and,
in spite of its otiose redundancy, this enthusiastic eulogy of Sidney is
pleasant reading.

In 1592, doubtless prior to the death of Greene, Nash published the
earliest of his important books, the volume entitled "Pierce Penniless
his Supplication to the Devil." This is a grotesque satire on the vices
and the eccentricities of the age. As a specimen of prose style it is
remarkable for its spirit and "go," qualities which may enable us to
forget how turbid, ungraceful, and harsh it is. Nash had now dropped
the mannerism of the Euphuists; he had hardly gained a style of his
own. "Pierce Penniless," with its chains of "letter-leaping metaphors,"
rattles breathlessly on, and at length abruptly ceases. Any sense of
the artistic fashioning of a sentence, or of the relative harmony of the
parts of a composition, was not yet dreamed of. But before we condemn
the muddy turbulence of the author, we must recollect that nothing
had then been published of Hooker, Raleigh, or Bacon in the pedestrian
manner. Genuine English prose had begun to exist indeed, but had not
yet been revealed to the world. Nash, as a lively portrait-painter in
grotesque, at this time, is seen at his best in such a caricature as
this, scourging "the pride of the Dane":--

"The most gross and senseless proud dolts are the Danes, who stand so
much upon their unwieldy burly-boned soldiery, that they account of
no man that hath not a battle-axe at his girdle to hough dogs with, or
wears not a cock's feather in a thrummed hat like a cavalier. Briefly,
he is the best fool braggart under heaven. For besides nature hath lent
him a flab-berkin face, like one of the four winds, and cheeks that sag
like a woman's dug over his chinbone, his apparel is so stuffed up with
bladders of taffaty, and his back like beef stuffed with parsley, so
drawn out with ribbands and devises, and blistered with light sarcenet
bastings, that you would think him nothing but a swarm of butterflies,
if you saw him afar off."

On the 3rd of September, 1592, Greene came to his miserable end, having
sent to the press from his deathbed those two remarkable pamphlets, the
"Groatsworth of Wit" and the "Repentance." For two years past, if we may
believe Nash, the profligate atheism of the elder poet had estranged his
friend, or at all events had kept him at a distance. But a feeling of
common loyalty, and the anger which a true man of letters feels when a
genuine poet is traduced by a pedant, led Nash to take up a very strong
position as a defender of the reputation of Greene. Gabriel Harvey,
although the friend of Spenser, is a personage who fills an odious place
in the literary history of the last years of Elizabeth. He was a scholar
and a university man of considerable attainments, but he was wholly
without taste, and he concentrated into vinegar a temper which must
always have had a tendency to be sour. In particular, he loathed the
school of young writers who had become famous in direct opposition to
the literary laws which he had laid down.

Harvey's wrath had found a definite excuse in the tract, called "A Quip
for an upstart Courtier, or a quaint dispute between Velvet-Breeches
and Cloth-Breeches," which Greene had published early in the year
1592. Accordingly, when he heard of Greene's death, he hastened to his
lodgings, interviewed his landlady, collected scurrilous details, and,
with matchless bad taste, issued, before the month was over, his "Four
Letters," a pamphlet in which he trampled upon the memory of Greene. In
the latest of his public utterances, Greene had made an appeal to three
friends, who, though not actually named, are understood to have been
Marlowe, Peele, and Nash.

Of these, the last was the one with the readiest pen, and the task of
punishing Harvey fell upon him.

Nash's first attack on Harvey took the form of a small volume, entitled,
"Strange News of the Intercepting of Certain Letters," published
very early in 1593. It was a close confutation of the charges made in
Harvey's "Four Letters," the vulgarity and insolence of the pedant
being pressed home with an insistence which must have been particularly
galling to him as coming from a distinguished man of his own university,
twenty years his junior. Harvey retorted with the heavy artillery of his
"Pierce's Supererogation," which was mainly directed against Nash, whom
the disappearance of Peele, and the sudden death of Marlowe in June, had
left without any very intimate friend as a supporter. Nash retired,
for the moment, from the controversy, and in the prefatory epistle to a
remarkable work, the most bulky of all his books, "Christ's Tears over
Jerusalem," he waved the white flag. He bade, he declared, "a hundred
unfortunate farewells to fantastical satirism," and complimented his
late antagonist on his "abundant scholarship." Harvey took no notice of
this, and for four years their mutual animosity slumbered. In this same
year, 1593, Nash produced the only play which has come down to us
as wholly composed by him, the comedy of "Summer's Last Will and
Testament."

Meanwhile "Pierce Penniless" had enjoyed a remarkable success, and had
placed Nash in a prominent position among London men of letters. We
learn that in 1596, four years after its original publication, it had
run through six editions, besides being translated in 1594 into French,
and, a little later, into Macaronic Latin. In "Christ's Tears" the young
writer, conscious of his new importance, deals with what the critics
have said about his style. He tells us, and we cannot wonder at it, that
objections have been made to "my boisterous compound words, and ending
my Italianate coined verbs all in _ize_." His defence is not unlike
that of De Quincey; we can imagine his asking, when urged to be simple,
whether simplicity be in place in a description of Belshazzar's Feast He
says that the Saxon monosyllables that swarm in the English tongue are a
scandal to it, and that he is only turning this cheap silver trash into
fine gold coinage. Books, he says, written in plain English, "seem
like shopkeepers' boxes, that contain nothing else save halfpence,
three-farthings, and two-pences." To show what sort of doubloons he
proposes to mint for English pockets, we need go no further than the
opening phrases of his dedication of this very book to that amiable
poet, the Lady Elizabeth Carey:--

"Excellent accomplished court-glorifying Lady, give me leave, with the
sportive sea-porpoises, preludiately a little to play before the storm
of my tears, to make my prayer before I proceed to my sacrifice. Lo, for
an oblation to the rich burnished shrine of your virtue, a handful of
Jerusalem's mummianized earth, in a few sheets of waste paper enwrapped,
I here, humiliate, offer up at your feet."

These, however, in spite of the odd neologisms, are sentences formed in
a novel and a greatly improved manner, and the improvement is sustained
throughout this curious volume. Probably the intimate study of the
Authorized Version of the Bible, which this semi-theological tractate
necessitated, had much to do with the clarification of the author's
style. At all events, from this time forth, Nash drops, except in
polemical passages where his design is provocative, that irritating
harshness in volubility which had hitherto marked his manner of writing.
Here, for example, is a passage from "Christ's Tears" which is not
without a strangely impressive melody:--

"Over the Temple, at the solemn feast of the Passover, was seen a comet
most coruscant, streamed and tailed forth, with glistering naked swords,
which in his mouth, as a man in his hand all at once, he made semblance
as if he shaked and vambrashed. Seven days it continued; all which time,
the Temple was as clear and light in the night as it had been noonday.
In the Sanctum Sanctorum was heard clashing and hewing of armour, while
flocks of ravens, with a fearful croaking cry, beat, fluttered and
clashed against the windows. A hideous dismal owl, exceeding all her
kind in deformity and quantity, in the Temple-porch built her nest. From
under the altar there issued penetrating plangorous howlings and ghastly
deadmen's groans."

He tells us, in the preface, that he takes an autumnal air, and in truth
there is a melancholy refinement in this volume which we may seek for
in vain elsewhere in Nash's writings. The greater part of the book is
a "collachrimate oration" over Jerusalem, placed in the mouth of our
Saviour; by degrees the veil of Jerusalem grows thinner and thinner,
and we see more and more clearly through it the London of Elizabeth,
denounced by a pensive and not, this time, a turbulent satirist.

In 1594 Nash's pen was particularly active. It was to the Lady Elizabeth
Carey, again, that he dedicated "The Terrors of the Night," a discourse
on apparitions. He describes some very agreeable ghosts, as, for
instance, those which appeared to a gentleman, a friend of the author's,
in the guise of "an inveigling troop of naked virgins, whose odoriferous
breath more perfumed the air than ordnance would that is charged with
amomum, musk, civet and ambergreece." It was surely a mock-modesty which
led Nash to fear that such ghost-stories as these would appear to his
readers duller than Holland cheese and more tiresome than homespun. To
1594, too, belongs the tragedy of "Dido," probably left incomplete by
Marlowe, and finished by Nash, who shows himself here an adept in
that swelling bombast of bragging blank verse of which he affected to
disapprove. A new edition of "Christ's Tears" also belongs to this busy
year 1594, which however is mainly interesting to us as having seen the
publication of the work which we are here introducing to modern readers.

An eminent French critic, M. Jusserand, whose knowledge of English
sixteenth-century literature is unsurpassed, was the first to draw
attention to the singular interest which attaches to "The Unfortunate
Traveller, or the Life of Jack Wilton," 1594. In his treatise, "Le Roman
au Temps de Shakespeare," 1887, M. Jusserand insisted upon the fact
that this neglected book was the best specimen of the _picaresque_ tale
written in English before the days of Defoe. He shows that expressions
put in the mouth of Nash's hero, which had been carelessly treated as
autobiographical confessions of foreign travel and the like, on the part
of the author, were but features of a carefully planned fiction. "Jack
Wilton" describes the career of an adventurer, from his early youth as
a page in the royal camp of Henry VIII. at the siege of Tournay, to his
attainment of wealth, position, and a beautiful Italian wife.

The first exploit of the page is an encounter with a fraudulent
innkeeper, which is described with great spirit, and M. Jusserand
has ingeniously surmised that Shakespeare, after reading these pages,
determined to fuse the two characters, mine host and the waggish
picaroon, into the single immortal figure of Falstaff. After this point
in the tale, it is probable that the reader may find the interest of
the story flag; but his attention will be reawakened when he reaches
the episode of the Earl of Surrey and Fair Geraldine, and that in
which Jack, pretending to be Surrey, runs off with his sweet Venetian
mistress, Diamante. It will be for the reader of the ensuing pages to
say whether Nash had mastered the art of narrative quite so perfectly
as M. Jusserand, in his just pride as a discoverer, seems to think. The
romance, no doubt, is incoherent and languid at times, and is easily led
aside into channels of gorgeous description and vain moral reflection.

It will doubtless be of interest, at this point, to quote the words
in which, in a later volume, M. Jusserand has reiterated his praise of
"Jack Wilton" and his belief in Nash as the founder of the British novel
of character:--

"In the works of Nash and his imitators, the different parts are badly
dovetailed; the novelist is incoherent and incomplete; the fault lies in
some degree with the picaresque form itself. Nash, however, pointed out
the right road, the road that was to lead to the true novel. He was
the first among his compatriots to endeavour to relate in prose a
long-sustained story, having for its chief concern: the truth.... No
one, Ben Jonson excepted, possessed at that epoch, in so great a degree
as himself, a love of the honest truth. With Nash, then, the novel of
real life, whose invention in England is generally attributed to Defoe,
begins. To connect Defoe with the past of English literature, we must
get over the whole of the seventeenth century, and go back to 'Jack
Wilton,' the worthy brother of 'Roxana,' 'Moll Flanders,' and 'Colonel
Jack.'"

It is to be regretted that Nash made no second adventure in pure
fiction. "Jack Wilton," now one of the rarest of his books, was never
reprinted in its own age.

How Nash was employed during the next two years, it is not easy to
conjecture. When we meet with him once more, the smouldering fire of his
quarrel with the Harveys had burst again into flame. "Have with you to
Saffron Walden," 1596, is devoted to the chastisement of "the reprobate
brace of brothers, to wit, witless Gabriel and ruffling Richard." No
fresh public outburst on Harvey's part seems to have led to this
attack; but he bragged in private that he had silenced his licentious
antagonists. Nash admits that his opponent's last book "has been kept
idle by me, in a bye-settle out of sight amongst old shoes and boots
almost this two year." Harvey was known to have come from Saffron
Walden; Nash invites his readers to accompany him to that town to see
what they can discover, and he retails a good deal of lively scandal
about the rope-maker's sons. "Have with you" is perhaps the smartest and
is certainly the most readable of Nash's controversial volumes. It gives
us, too, some interesting fragments of autobiography. Harvey had accused
him of "prostituting his pen like a courtisan," and Nash makes this
curious and not very lucid statement in selfdefence:--

"Neither will I deny it nor will I grant it. Only thus far I'll go with
you, that twice or thrice in a month, when _res est angusta domi_, the
bottom of my purse is turned downward, and my conduit of ink will no
longer flow for want of reparations, I am fain to let my plough stand
still in the midst of a furrow, and follow some of these newfangled
Galiardos and Senior Fantasticos, to whose amorous _villanellas_ and
_quipassas_, I prostitute my pen in hope of gain.... Many a fair day ago
have I proclaimed myself to the world Piers Penniless."

Gabriel Harvey must have felt, on reading "Have with you to Saffron
Walden," that his antagonist was right in saying that his pen carried
"the hot shot of a musket." Unfortunately, while Harvey was smarting
under these insulting gibes and jests, the jester himself got into
public trouble. Little is known of the circumstance which led the
Queen's Privy Council, in the summer of 1597, to throw Nash into the
Fleet Prison, but it was connected with the performance of a comedy
called "The Isle of Dogs," which gave offence to the authorities. This
play was not printed, and is no longer in existence. The Lord Admiral's
Company of actors, which produced it, had its licence withdrawn until
the 27th of August, when Nash was probably liberated. Gabriel Harvey was
not the man to allow this event to go unnoticed. He hurried into
print with his "Trimming of Thomas Nash," 1597, a pamphlet of the most
outrageous abuse addressed "to the polypragmatical, parasitupocritical
and pantophainoudendecontical puppy Thomas Nash," and adorned with a
portrait of that gentleman in irons, with heavy gyves upon his ankles.
According to Nash, however, the part of "The Isle of Dogs" which was
his composition was so trifling in extent that his imprisonment was
a gratuitous act of oppression. How the play with this pleasing title
offended has not been handed down to us.

Nash was now a literary celebrity, and yet it is at this precise moment
that his figure begins to fade out of sight For the next two years he is
not known to have made any public appearance. In 1599 he published the
best of all his books; it was unfortunately the latest "Nash's Lenten
Stuff; or, the Praise of the Red Herring" is an encomium on the
hospitable town of Yarmouth, to which, in the autumn of 1597, he had
fled for consolation, and in which, through six happy weeks, he had
found what he sought The "kind entertainment and benign hospitality"
of the compassionate clime of Yarmouth deserve from the poor exile a
cordial return, and, accordingly, he sings the praise of the Red Herring
as richly as if his mouth were still tingling with the delicate bloater.
In this book, Nash is kind enough to explain to us the cause of some of
the peculiarities of his style. His endeavour has been to be Italianate,
and "of all styles I most affect and strive to imitate Aretine's."

Whether he was deeply read in the works of _il divino Aretino_, we may
doubt; but it is easy to see that this Scourge of Princes, the very type
of the emancipated Italian of the sixteenth century, might have a vague
and dazzling attraction for his little eager English imitator.

Be that as it may, "Lenten Stuff" gives us evidence that Nash had now
arrived at a complete mastery of the fantastic and irrelevant manner
which he aimed at. This book is admirably composed, if we can bring
ourselves to admit that the _genre_ is ever admirable. The writer's
vocabulary has become opulent, his phrases flash and detonate, each
page is full of unconnected sparks and electrical discharges. A sort
of aurora borealis of wit streams and rustles across the dusky surface,
amusing to the reader, but discontinuous, and insufficient to illuminate
the matter in hand. It is extraordinary that a man can make so many
picturesque, striking, and apparently apposite remarks, and yet leave us
so frequently in doubt as to his meaning. If this was the result of the
imitation of Aretino, Nash's choice of a master was scarcely a fortunate
one.

Thomas Nash was now thirty-two years of age, and with the publication of
"Lenten Stuff" we lose sight of him. His old play of "Summers' Last Will
and Testament" was printed in 1600, and he probably died in that year.
The song at the close of that comedy or masque reads like the swan-song
of its author:--

     Autumn hath all the summer's fruitful treasure;
     Gone is our sport, fled is poor [Nash's] pleasure!
     Short days, sharp days, long nights come on apace;

     Ah! who shall hide us from the winter's face?
     Cold doth increase, the sickness will not cease,
     And here we lie, God knows, with little ease:

     From winter, plague and pestilence,
     Good Lord, deliver us!

     London doth mourn, Lambeth is quite forlorn,
     Trades cry, Woe worth that ever they were born;
     The want of term is town and city's harm.

     Close chambers we do want, to keep us warm;
     Long banished must we live from our friends:
     This low-built house will bring us to our ends.

     From winter, plague and pestilence,
     Good Lord, deliver us!

Whether pestilence or winter slew him, we do not know. In 1601
Fitzgeoffrey published a short Latin elegy on Nash in his "Affaniae,"
alluding in happy phrase to the twin lightnings of his armed tongue
and his terrible pen; and Nash had six lines of tempered praise in "The
Return from Parnassus." But all we know of the cause or manner of Nash's
death has to be collected from a passage in "A Knight's Conjuring,"
1607, written by the satirist on whom his mantle descended, Thomas
Dekker. Nash is seen advancing along the Elysian Fields:--

"Marlowe, Greene, and Peele had got under the shades of a large vine,
laughing to see Nash, that was but newly come to their college, still
haunted with the sharp and satirical spirit that followed him here
upon earth; for Nash inveighed bitterly, as he had wont to do, against
dry-fisted patrons, accusing them of his untimely death, because if they
had given his Muse that cherishment which she most worthily deserved, he
had fed to his dying day on fat capons, burnt sack and sugar, and not
so desperately have ventured his life and shortened his days by keeping
company with pickle herrings."

This looks as though Nash died of a disease attributed to coarse and
unwholesome cheap food. His fame proved to be singularly ephemeral. So
far as I am aware, no book of his was reprinted after his death, with
the single exception of "Christ's Tears over Jerusalem," which was
issued again in 1613. His name was mentioned and some interest in his
writings was awakened at the close of the next century by Winstanley and
by Langbaine, but Oldys, the celebrated antiquary, was the first person
who seriously endeavoured to trace the incidents of his life.

Dr. A. B. Grosart saved the works of Nash from all danger of destruction
by printing an issue of them, in six volumes, for fifty private
subscribers, in 1883-85. But he still remains completely inaccessible to
the general reader.

The Life of Iacke Wilton.


LONDON.

[Illustration: Dedication]


To THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD Henrie Wriothsley,

Earle of sovthhampton,
and baron OF TICHFEELD.

Ingenvovs honorable Lord, I know not what blinde custome methodicall
antiquity hath thrust vpon vs, to dedicate such books as we publish,
to one great man or other; In which respect, least anie man should
challenge these my papers as goods vncustomd, and so, extend vpon them
as forfeite to contempt, to the seale of your excellent censure loe here
I present them to bee seene and allowed. Prize them as high or as low as
you list: if you set anie price on them, I hold my labor well satisfide.
Long haue I desired to approoue my wit vnto you. My reuerent duetifull
thoughts (euen from their infancie) haue been retayners to your glorie.
Now at last I haue enforst an opportunitie to plead my deuoted
minde. All that in this phantasticall Treatise I can promise, is some
reasonable conueyance of historie, & varietie of mirth. By diuers of my
good frends haue I been dealt with to employ my dul pen in this kinde,
it being a cleane different vaine from other my former courses of
writing. How wel or ill I haue done in it, I am ignorant: (the eye that
sees roundabout it selfe, sees not into it selfe): only your
Honours applauding encouragement hath power to make mee arrogant.
Incomprehensible is the heigth of your spirit both in heroical
resolution and matters of conceit. Vnrepriueably perisheth that booke
whatsoeuer to wast paper, which on the diamond rocke of your iudgement
disasterly chanceth to be shipwrackt. A dere louer and cherisher you
are, as well of the louers of Poets, as of Poets themselues. Amongst
their sacred number I dare not ascribe my selfe, though now and then
I speak English: that smal braine I haue, to no further vse I conuert,
saue to be kinde to my frends, and fatall to my enemies. A new brain, a
new wit, a new stile, a new soule will I get mee, to canonize your
name to posteritie, if in this my first attempt I be not taxed of
presumption. Of your gracious fauor I despaire not, for I am not
altogether Fames outcast. This handfull of leaues I offer to your
view, to the leaues on trees I compare, which as they cannot grow of
themselues except they haue some branches or boughes to cleaue too,
& with whose iuice and sap they be euermore recreated & nourisht: so
except these vnpolisht leaues of mine haue some braunch of Nobilitie
whereon to depend and cleaue, and with the vigorous nutriment of whose
authorized commendation they may be continually fosterd and refresht,
neuer wil they grow to the worlds good liking, but forthwith fade
and die on the first houre of their birth. Your Lordship is the large
spreading branch of renown, from whence these my idle leaues seeke to
deriue their whole nourishing: it resteth you either scornfully shake
them off, as wormeaten & worthies, or in pity preserue them and cherish
them, for some litle summer frute you hope to finde amongst them.

Your Honors in all humble seruice: Tho: Nashe.

THE INDVCTION TO THE DAPPER MOVNSIER PAGES OF THE COVRT.

Gallant squires, haue amongst you: at mumchance I meane not, for so I
might chaunce come to short commons, but at _nouus, noua, nouum_, which
is in English, newes of the maker. A proper fellow Page of yours called
_Iacke Wilton_, by mee commends him vnto you, and hath bequeathed for
wast paper heere amongst you certaine pages of his misfortunes. In any
case keep them preciously as a _Priuie_ token of his good will towards
you. If there be some better than other, he craues you would honor them
in their death so much, as to drie and kindle _Tobacco_ with them: for
a need he permits you to wrap veluet pantofles in them also, so they be
not woe begone at the heeles, or weather-beaten like a blacke head with
graye haires, or mangie at the toes like an ape about the mouth. But
as you loue good fellowship and ames ace, rather turne them to stop
mustard-pots, than the Grocers shuld haue one patch of them to wrap mace
in: a strong hot costly spice it is, which aboue all things hee hates.
To anie vse about meate or drinke put them too and spare not, for they
cannot doo their Countrey better seruice. Printers are madde whoresons,
allow them some of them for napkins. lost a little nerer to the matter
and the purpose. _Memorandum_, euerie one of you after the perusing of
this Pamphlet, is to prouide him a case of ponyards, that if you come in
companie with any man which shall dispraise it or speake against it, you
may straight cry Sic respondeo, and giue him the stockado. It stands not
with your honors (I assure yee) to haue a Gentleman and a Page abusde in
his absence. Secondly, whereas you were wont to sweare men on a pantofle
to bee true to your puissaunt order, you shall sweeare them on nothing
but this Chronicle of the King of Pages henceforward. Thirdly, it shalbe
lawfull for anie whatsoeuer to play with false dice in a corner on the
couer of this foresaid Acts and monuments. None of the fraternitie of
the minorites shall refuse it for a pawne in the times of famine and
necessitie. Euery Stationers stall they passe by whether by day or by
night they shall put off their hats too, and make a low leg, in regard
their grand printed Capitano is there entoombd. It shalbe flat treason
for any of this forementioned catalogue of the point trussers, once
to name him within fortie foote of an ale-house. Marry the tauerne
is honorable. Many speciall graue articles more had I to giue you in
charge, which your wisdomes waiting together at the bottome of the great
Chamber staires, or sitting in a porch (your parlament house) may better
consider of than I can deliuer: onely let this suffice for a tast to the
text & a bit to pull on a good wit with, as a rasher on the coales is
to pull on a cup of wine. Heigh passe, come aloft: euery man of you take
your places, and heare _Iacke Wilton_ tell his owne tale.

THE VNFORTVNATE TRAVELLER.

Abovt that time that the terror of the world, and feauer quartan of
the French, _Henrie_ the eight, (the onely true subiect of Chronicles)
aduanced his standard against the two hundred and fiftie towers of
_Turney_ and _Turwin_, and had the Empereur and all the nobility of
Flanders, Holland, and Brabant as mercenarie attendants on his fulsailed
fortune, I _Jacke Wilton_ (a Gentleman at lest) was a certaine kinde of
an appendix or page, belonging or appertaining in or vnto the confines
of the English court, where what my credit was, a number of my creditors
that I coosned can testifie, _Cælum petimus stultitia_, which of vs all
is not a sinner. Be it knowen to as many as will paie monie inough to
peruse my storie, that I followed the campe or the court, or the court &
the camp, when _Turwin_ lost her maidenhead, & opened her gates to more
than _Iane Trosse_ did. There did I (soft let me drinke before I goe
anie further) raigne sole king of the cans and black iackes, prince
of the pigmeis, countie paltaine of cleane strawe and prouant, and to
conclude, Lord high regent of rashers of the coles and red herring cobs.
_Paulo maiora canamus_: well, to the purpose. What stratagemicall actes
and monuments do you thinke an ingenious infant of my age might enact?
you will saie, it were sufficient if he slurre a die, pawne his master
to the vtmost pennie, & minister the oath on the pantoffle arteficially.
These are signes of good education, I must confesse, and arguments of
In grace and vertue to proceed. Oh but _Aliquid latet quod non patet_,
theres a farther path I must trace: examples confirme, list Lordings
to my proceedinges. Whosoeuer is acquainted with the state of a campe,
vnderstands that in it be many quarters, & yet not so many as on London
bridge. In those quarters are many companies: Much companie, much
knauerie, as true as that olde adage, Much curtesie, much subtiltie.
Those companies, like a great deale of corne, doe yeeld some chaffe, the
corne are cormorants, the chaffe are good fellowes, which are quickly
blowen to nothing, with bearing a light hart in a light purse. Amongst
this chaffe was I winnowing my wits to liue merily, and by my troth so I
did: the prince could but command men spend theyr bloud in his seruice,
I coulde make them spend all the monie they had for my pleasure. But
pouerty in the end parts frends, though I was prince of their purses,
and exacted of my vnthrift subiects, as much liquid allégeance as anie
keisar in the world could do, yet where it is not to be had the king
must loose his right, want cannot be withstood, men can doe no more than
they can doe, what remained then, but the foxes case must help, when the
lions skin is out at the elbowes.

There was a Lord in the campe, let him be a Lord of misrule, if you wil,
for he kept a plaine alehouse without welt or gard of anie Iuibush, and
solde syder and cheese by pint and by pound to all that came (at that
verie name of syder, I can but sigh, there is so much of it in renish
wine now a dayes). Wei, _Tendit ad sydera virtus_, thers great vertue
belongs (I can tell you) to a cup of syder, and verie good men haue
solde it, and at sea it is _Aqua colestis_, but thats neither heere
nor there, if it had no other patrone but this peere of quart pots to
authorize it, it were sufficient This great Lorde, this worthie Lord,
this noble Lord, thought no scorne (Lord haue mercy vpon vs) to haue his
great veluet breeches larded with the droppings of this daintie liquor,
& yet he was an olde senator, a cauelier of an ancient house, as it
might appeare by the armes of his ancestrie, drawen very amiably in
chalke, on the in side of his tent doore.

He and no other was the man, I chose out to damne with a lewd monylesse
deuice: for comming to him on a daie, as he was counting his barrels, &
setting the price in chalke on the head of euerie one of them, I did my
dutie verie deuoutly, and tolde his _alie_ honor, I had matters of
some secrecie to impart vnto him, if it pleased him to grant me priuate
audience. With me young _Wilton_ quoth he, marie and shalt: bring vs a
pint of syder of a fresh tap into the three cups here, wash the pot, so
into a backe roome he lead mee, where after hee had spit on his finger,
and pickt off two or three moats of his olde moth eaten veluet cap, and
spunged and wrong all the rumatike driuell from his ill fauoured Goates
beard, he badde me declare my minde, and there vpon he dranke to me on
the same. I vp with a long circumstance, alias, a cunning shift of the
seuenteenes, & discourst vnto him what entire affection I had borne him
time out of mind, partly for the high discent and linage from whence
he sprung, & partly for the tender care and prouident respect he had of
poore soldiers, that whereas the vastitie of that place (which afforded
them no indifferent supplie of drinke or of victuals) might humble them
to some extremity, and so weaken their hands, he vouchsafed in his own
person to be a victualer to the campe (a rare example of magnificence &
honorable curtesie) and diligently prouided, that without farre trauel,
euery man might for his money haue syder and cheese his bellyfull, nor
did he sell his cheese by the way onely, or his syder by the great, but
abast himselfe with his owne hands, to take a shoomakers knife (a homely
instrument for such a high personage to touch) and cut it out equally
like a true iusticiarie, in little pennyworthes, that it woulde doo a
man good for to looke vpon. So likewise of his syder, the pore man might
haue his moderate draught of it (as there is a moderation in all things)
as well for his doit or his dandiprat, as the rich man for his halfe
souse or his denier. Not so much, quoth I, but this tapsters linnen
apron, which you weare before you, to protect your appareil from the
imperfections of the spigot, most amply bewrais your lowly minde. I
speake it with teares, too fewe such humble spirited noble men haue we,
that will draw drinke in linen aprons. Why you are euerie childs felow,
any man that comes vnder the name of a souldier and a goodfellowe, you
will sitte and beare companie to the last pot, yea, and you take in
as good part the homely phrase of mine host heeres to you, as if one
saluted you by all the titles of your baronie. These considerations,
I saie, which the world suffers to slippe by in the channell of
carelesnes, haue moued me in ardent zeale of your welfare, to forewarne
you of some dangers that haue beset you & your barrels. At the name of
dangers hee start up, and bounst with his fist on the boord so hard,
that his Tapster ouerhearing him, cried anone anone sir, by and by, and
came and made a low leg and askt him what he lackt. Hee was readie to
haue striken his Tapster, for interrupting him in attention of this his
so much desired relation, but for feare of displeasing me he moderated
his furie, and onely sending him for the other fresh pint, wild him
looke to the barre, and come when hee is cald with a deuilles name.
Well, at his earnest importunitie, after I had moistned my lips, to make
my lie runne glib to his iourneies end, forward I went as followeth. It
chaunced me the other night, amongst other pages, to attend where the
king with his Lords, and many chiefe leaders sate in counsel, there
amongst sundrie serious matters that were debated, and intelligences
from the enemy giuen vp, it was priuily informed (no villains to these
priuie informers) that you, euen you that I now speak to, would I
had no tongue to tell the rest, by this drink it grieues me so I am not
able to repeate it. Nowe was my dronken Lord redie to hang himself for
the end of the ful point, and ouer my necke he throws himselfe verie
lubberly, and intreated me as I was a proper young Gentleman, and euer
lookt for pleasure at his hands, soone to rid him out of this hell of
suspence, & resolue him of the rest, then fell hee on his knees, wrong
his handes, and I thinke, on my conscience, wept out all the syder that
he had dronke in a weeke before, to moue me to haue pitie on him, he
rose and put his rustie ring on my finger, gaue me his greasie purse
with that single money that was in it, promised to make mee his heire,
& a thousand more fauours, if I would expire the miserie of his
vnspeakable tormenting vncertaintie. I being by nature inclined to
_Mercie_ (for indeed I knew two or three good wenches of that name) bad
him harden his eares, & not make his eyes abortiue before their time,
and he should haue the inside of my brest turnd outward, heare such a
tale as would tempt the vtmost strength of life to attend it, and not
die in the middest of it. Why (quoth I) my selfe, that am but a poore
childish welwiller of yours, with the verie thought, that a man of
your desert and state, by a number of pesants and varlets should be so
iniuriously abused in hugger mugger, haue wept al my vrine vpward. The
wheele vnder our Citie bridge, carries not so much water ouer the city,
as my braine hath welled forth gushing streames of sorow. I haue wept so
immoderatly and lauishly, that I thought verily my palat had bin turned
to pissing conduit in London. My eies haue bin dronk, outragiously
dronke, with giuing but ordinary entercourse through their sea-circled
Hands to my distilling dreariment What shal I saie? that which malice
hath sayde is the meere ouerthrow & murder of your daies. Change not
your colour, none can slander a cleere conscience to it selfe, receiue
all your fraught of misfortune in at once.

It is buzzed in the kings head that you are a secret friend to the
enemy, & vnder pretence of getting a license to furnish the campe with
syder and such like prouant, you haue furnisht the enemy, and in emptie
barrells sent letters of discouerie, and come innumerable, I might well
haue left here, for by this time his white liuer had mixt it selfe
with the white of his eie, & both were turned vpwardes, as if they had
offered themselues a fayre white for death to shoote at. The troth was,
I was verie loth mine hoste and I should parte to heauen with dry lips,
wherefore the best meanes that I could imagine to wake him out of his
traunce, was to crie loude in his eare, hough host, whats to pay, will
no man looke to the reckning heere and in plaine veritie, it tooke
expected effect, for with the noise he started and bustled, like a man
that had beene scard with fyre out of his sleepe, and ranne hastily
to his Tapster, and all to belaboured him about the eares, for letting
Gentlemen call so long and not looke in to them. Presently he remembred
himselfe, and had like to haue fallen into his memento againe, But that
I met him halfe waies, and askt his Lordship what he meant to slip
his necke out of the coller so sodainly, and being reuiued, strike his
tapster so rashly.

Oh, quoth he, I am bought & solde for doing my Country such good seruice
as I haue done. They are afraid of mee, because my good deedes haue
brought me into such estimation with the communalty, I see, I see it is
not for the lambe to liue with the wolfe.

The world is well amended, thought I, with your Sidership, such another
fortie yeeres nappe together as _Epemenides_ had, would make you a
perfect wise man. Answere me, quoth he, my wise young _Wilton_, is it
true that I am thus vnderhand dead and buried by these bad tongues?

Nay, quoth I, you shall pardon me, for I haue spoken too much alreadie,
no definitiue sentence of death shall march out of my wel meaning lips,
they haue but lately suckt milke, and shall they so sodainly change
theyr food and seeke after bloud?

Oh but, quoth he, a mans friend is his friend, fill the other pint
Tapster, what sayd the king, did hee beleeue it when hee heard it, I
pray thee say, I sweare to thee by my nobility, none in the worlde shall
euer be made priuie, that I receiued anie light of this matter from
thee.

That firme affiance, quoth I, had I in you before, or else I would neuer
haue gone so farre ouer the shooes, to plucke you out of the mire. Not
to make many wordes (since you will needs know) the king saies flatly,
you are a miser & a snudge, and he neuer hopt better of you. Nay then
(quoth he) questionlesse some planet that loues not syder hath conspired
against me. Moreouer, which is worse, the king hath vowed to giue
_Turwin_ one hot breakfast, onely with the bungs that hee will plucke
out of your barrells. I cannot staie at this time to reporte each
circumstance that passed, but the only counsell that my long cherished
kinde inclination can possibly contriue, is now in your olde daies to be
liberall, such victuals or prouisions as you haue, presently distribute
it frankly amongst poore souldiers, I would let them burst their bellies
with syder, and bathe in it, before I would runne into my Princes ill
opinion for a whole sea of it. The hunter pursuing the beauer for his
stones, hee bites them off, and leaues them behinde for him to gather
vp, whereby he liues quiet. If greedie hunters and hungry teltales
pursue you, it is for a little pelfe which you haue, cast it behind you,
neglect it, let them haue it, lest it breed a further inconuenience.
Credit my aduice, you shall finde it propheticall, and thus I haue
discharged the parte of a poore friend. With some few like phrases of
ceremonie, your honors suppliant, & so forth, and farewel my good youth,
I thanke thee and will remember thee, we parted. But the next daie I
thinke we had a dole of syder, syder in boules, in scuppets, in helmets,
& to conclude, if a man would haue fild his bootes full, there hee
might haue had it, prouant thrust it selfe into poore souldiers pockets
whether they would or no. We made fiue peals of shot into the towne
together, of nothing but spiggots and faussets of discarded emptie
barrels: euerie vnderfoote soildiour had a distenanted tunne, as
_Diogenes_ had his tub to sleepe in, I my selfe got as many confiscated
Tapsters aprons, as made me a Tent, as bigge as any ordinarie commanders
in the field. But in conclusion, my welbeloued Baron of double beere got
him humbly on his marybones to the king, and complained hee was olde and
striken in yeres, and had nere an heire to cast at a dogge, wherefore if
it might please his maiesty to take his lands into his hands, and allowe
him some reasonable pension to liue on, hee shoulde bee meruailous wel
pleased: as for the warres, he was wearie of them, and yet as long as
highnes shoulde venture his owne person, hee would not flinch a foot,
but make his withered bodie a buckler, to beare off anie blow that
should be aduanced agaynst him.

The king meruailing at this strange alteration of his great marchant of
syder (for so hee woulde often pleasantly tearme him), with a little
further talke bolted out the whole complotment Then was I pittifully
whipt for my holy day lie, although they made themselues merrie with it
many a faire winters euening after.

Yet notwithstanding his good asseheaded honor mine host, perseuered in
his former simple request to the king to accept of the surrender of
his landes, and allowe him a beadsmanry or out-brother-ship of brachet,
which at length, through his vehement instancie tooke effect, and the
king ieastingly sayd, since he would needs haue it so, he would distrain
on part of his land for impost of syder, which hee was behinde hande
with him, and neuer payd.

This was one of my famous atchieuements, insomuch as I neuer light vpon
the like famous foole, but I haue done a thousand better ieasts if they
had bin bookt in order as they were begotten. It is pittie posteritie
shoulde bee depriued of such precious recordes, and yet there is no
remedie, and yet there is to, for when all fayles, welfare a good
memorie. Gentle readers (looke you be gentle now since I haue cald you
so) as freely as my knauerie was mine owne, it shall be yours to vse in
the way of honestie.

Euen in this expedition of Turwin (for the king stoode not long
thrumming of buttons there) it happened me fall out (I would it had
fallen out otherwise for his sake) with an vgly mechanical Captaine. You
must thinke in an armie, where tronchios are in their state house, it is
a flat stab once to name a Captaine without cappe in hand. Well, suppose
hee was a Captaine, & had nere a good cap of his owne, but I was faine
to lend him one of my Lords cast veluet caps, and a weatherbeaten
feather, wherewith he threatned his souldiers a farre off, as Iupiter is
sayde, with the shaking of his haire to make heauen and earth to quake:
suppose out of the paringes of a paire of false dice, I apparelled both
him and my selfe many a time and oft: and surely not to slander the
deuill, if anie man euer deserued the golden dice, the king of the
Parthians sent to _Demetrius_ it was I, I had the right vaine of sucking
vp a die twixt the dintes of my fingers, not a creuise in my hande but
coulde swallowe a quater trey for a neede: in the line of life many a
dead lifte dyd there lurke, but it was nothing towards the maintenance
of a family. This Monsieur Capitano eate vp the creame of my earnings,
and _Crede mihi res est ingeniosa dare_, any man is a fine fellow
as long as he hath anie monie in his purse. That monie is like the
marigolde, which opens and shuts with the Sunne, if fortune smileth,
or one be in fauour, it floweth: if the euening of age comes on, or he
falleth into disgrace, it fadeth and is not to be found. I was my crafts
master though I was but yong, and could as soone decline _Nominatiuo hic
asinus_, as a greater clarke, wherefore I thought it not conuenient my
soldado should haue my purse anie longer for his drumme to play vppon,
but I woulde giue him Iacke drummes entertainment, and send him packing.
This was my plot, I knewe a peece of seruice of intelligence, which was
presently to bee done, that required a man with all his fiue senses to
effect it, and would ouefthrow anie foole that should vndertake it,
to this seruice did I animate and egge my foresayd costes and charges,
alias, senior veluet-cappe, whose head was not encombered with too much
forecast, and comming to him in his cabbin about dinner time, where I
found him verie deuoutly paring of his nailes for want of other repast,
I entertained him with this solemne oration.

Captaine, you perceiue how neere both of vs are driuen, the dice of late
are growen as melancholy as a dog, high men and low men both prosper
alike, langrets, fullams, and all the whole fellowshippe of them will
not affoord a man his dinner, some other means must be inuented to
preuent imminent extremitie. My state, you are not ignorant, depends on
trencher seruice, your aduancement must be deriued from the valour
of your arme. In the delayes of siege, desert hardly gets a daye of
hearing, tis gowns must direct and guns enact all the wars that is to
bee made against walls. Resteth no waie for you to climbe sodainly, but
by doing some straunge stratageme, that the like hath not bene heard of
heeretofore, and fitly at this instant occasion is ministred.

There is a feate the king is desirous to haue wrought on some great
man of the enemies side, marie it requireth not so much resolution as
discretion to bring it to passe, and yet resolution inough shalbe showen
in it to, being so full of hazardous ieopardy as it is, harke in
your eare, thus it is. Without more drumbling or pausing, if you will
vndertake it, and worke it through stitch (as you may ere the king hath
determined which waie to goe about it) I warrant you are made while you
liue, you neede not care which waie your staffe falles, if it proue not
so, then cut off my head.

Oh my auditors, had you seene him how he stretcht out his lims, scratcht
his scabd elbowes at this speech, how hee set his cap ouer his eie
browes like a polititian, and then folded his armes one in another, &
nodded with the head, as who should saie, let the French beware, for
they shall finde me a deuill, if I say, you had seen but halfe the
actions that he vsed of shrucking vp his shoulders, smiling scornfully,
playing with his fingers on his buttons, and biting the lip, you wold
haue laught your face and your knees together. The yron being hot, I
thought to lay on loade, for in anie case I would not haue his humour
coole. As before I layd open vnto him the briefe summe of the seruice,
so now I began to vrge the honorablenesse of it, and what a rare thing
it was to be a right polititian, how much esteemd of kings and princes,
and how diuerse of meane parentage haue come to be monarches by it. Then
I discourst of the qualities and properties of him in euerie respect,
how lyke the wolfe he must drawe the breath from a man before he be
seen, how lyke a hare he must sleepe with his eyes open, how as the
Eagle in flying casts dust in the eyes of crowes & other foules, for
to blind them, so he must cast dust in the eies of his enimies, delude
their sight by one meanes or other, y they diue not into his subtilties:
how he must be familiar with all & trust none, drinke, carouse and
lecher with him out of whom he hopes to wring anie matter, sweare and
forsweare, rather than be suspected, and in a word, haue the art of
dissembling at his fingers ends as perfect as anie courtier.

Perhaps (quoth I) you may haue some few greasie cauelliers that will
seeke to disswade you from it, and they will not sticke to stand on
theyr three halfe pennie honour, swearing and staring that a man were
better be an hangman than an intelligencer, and call him a sneaking
eausdropper, a scraping hedgecreeper, and a piperly pickthanke, but
you must not bee discouraged by theyr talke, for the most part of those
beggerly contemners of wit, are huge burlybond butchers like _Aiax_,
good for nothing but to strike right downe blowes on a wedge with a
cleauing beetle, or stande hammering all daie vppon barres of yron. The
whelpes of a Beare neuer grow but sleeping, and these bearewards hauing
big limmes shall bee preferd though they doe nothing. You haue read
stories, (He bee sworne he neuer lookte in booke in his life) how many
of the Romane worthies were there that haue gone as spies into theyr
enemies campe? _Vlysses, Nestor, Diomed_, went as spies together in the
night into the tentes of _Rhosus_ and intercepted _Dolon_ the spie
of the Troians: neuer anie discredited the trade of intelligencers
but _Iudas_, & he hanged himselfe. Danger will put wit into anie man.
_Architas_ made a wooden doue to flie: by which proportion I see no
reason that the veryest blocke in the world should despayre of anie
thing. Though nature be contrarie inclined, it may be altered, yet
vsually those whome she denies her ordinarie giftes in one thing, she
doubles them in another. That which the asse wants in wit, hee hath in
honestie, who euer sawe him kicke or winch, or vse anie iades trickes,
though he liue an hundred yeeres you shall never heare that he breakes
pasture. Amongest men, hee that hath not a good wit, lightly hath a
good yron memorie, and he that hath neither of both, hath some bones to
carrie burthens. Blinde men haue better noses than other men: the buls
horns serue him as well as hands to fight withall: the lions pawes are
as good to him as a polaxe, to knock downe anie that resists him: so the
Bores tushes serue him in better stead than a sword and buckler, what
need the snaile care for eyes, when he feeles the waie with his two
homes, as well as if hee were as sharpe sighted as a decypherer. There
is a fish that hauing no wings, supportes her selfe in the ayre with
her finnes. Admit that you had neither wit nor capacitie, as sure in my
iudgement there is none equall vnto you in idiotisme, yet if you haue
simplicitie and secrecie, serpents themselues will thinke you a serpent,
for what serpent is there but hydeth his sting: and yet whatsoeuer bee
wanting, a good plausible alluring tong in such a man of imployment can
hardly be spard, which as the forenamed serpent, with his winding tayle
fetcheth in those that come neere him: so with a rauishing tale, it
gathers all mens heartes vnto him, which if hee haue not, let him neuer
looke to ingender by the mouth, as rauens and doues doe, that is,
mount or be great by vndermining. Sir, I am assertayned that all these
imperfections I speake off, in you haue theyr naturall resiance, I see
in your face, that you were borne with the swallow, to feede flying,
to get much treasure and honour by trauell. None so fit as you for so
important an enterprise, our vulgar reputed polititians are but flyes
swimming on the streame of subtiltie superficially in comparison of
your singularitie, theyr blind narrowe eyes cannot pearce into the
profunditie of hypocrisie, you alone with _Palamed_, can pry into
_Vlysses_ madde counterfeting, you can discerne _Achilles_ from a
chamber maide, though he be deckt with his spindle and distaffe: as
_Ioue_ dining with _Licaon_ could not be beguiled with humane flesh
drest like meate, so no humane braine may goe beyond you, none beguile
you, you gull all, all feare you, loue you, stoupe to you. Therefore,
good sir, be rulde by mee, stoupe your fortune so lowe, as to bequeath
your selfe wholy to this businesse.

This siluer sounding tale made such sugred harmonie in his eares, that
with the sweete meditation, what a more than myraculous polititian
he should be, and what kingly promotion should come tumbling on him
thereby, he could haue found in his heart to haue packt vp his pipes &
to haue gone to heauen without a baite, yea, hee was more inflamed and
rauishte with it than a young man called _Tauritnontanus_ was with the
Phrigian melodie, who was so incensed and fyred therewith, that he would
needes runne presently vpon it, and set a curtizans house on fire that
had angered him.

No remedie there was but I must helpe to furnish him with monie, I did
so, as who wil not make his enemy a bridge of golde to flie by. Verie
earnestly he coniurd me to make no man liuing priuie to his departure
in regard of his place and charge, and on his honour assured mee his
returne shoulde bee verie short and succesfull, I, I, shorter by the
necke, thought I, in the meane time let this be thy posie, _I liue in
hope to scape the rope_.

Gone he is, God send him good shipping to Wapping, & by this time, if
you will, let him bee a pittifull poore fellowe, and vndone for euer,
for mine owne part, if he had bin mine owne brother, I coulde haue done
no more for him than I did, for straight after his backe was turnd, I
went in all loue & kindnesse to the Marshall generall of the field, &
certefide him that such a man was lately fled to the enemie, and gotte
his place beggd for another immediatly. What became of him after you
shall heare. To the enemie he went and offered his seruice, ratling
egregiously on the king of England, he swore, as he was a Gentleman
and a souldier, hee would bee reuenged on him, and let but the king of
France follow his counsell, hee woulde driue him from _Turwin_ wals yet
ere ten dayes to an end. All these were good humours, but the tragedie
followeth. The French king hearing of such a prating fellow that was
come, was desirous to see him, but yet he feared treason, wherfore he
wild one of his minions to take vpon him his person, and he would stand
by as a priuate man whilest hee was examined. Why should I vse anie idle
delayes? In was Captaine Gogges wounds brought, after he was throughly
searched, not a louse in his doublet was let passe, but was askt
_Queuela_, and chargd to stand in the kings name, the mouldes of his
buttons they turnd out, to see if they were not bullettes couered ouer
with thread, the codpeece in his deuills breeches (for they were then in
fashion) they sayd playnly was a case for a pistoll, if hee had had euer
a hobnaile in his shooes it had hangde him, & he shuld neuer haue knowen
who had harmd him, but as lucke was, he had not a mite of anie mettal
about him, he tooke part with none of the foure ages, neither the golden
age, the siluer age, the brasen nor the yron age, onely his purse was
aged in emptinesse, and I thinke verily a puritane, for it kept it selfe
from any pollution of crosses. Standing before the supposed king, he
was askt what he was, and wherefore he came. To the which in a glorious
bragging humour he aunswered, that hee was a gentleman, a captaine
commander, a chiefe leacjer, that came away from the king of England
vppon discontentment. Questiond particular of the cause of his
discontentment, hee had not a word to blesse himself with, yet faine he
would haue patcht out a poltfoote tale, but (God he knowes) it had not
one true legge to stand on. Then began he to smell on the villaine so
rammishly, that none there but was readie to rent him in peeces, yet the
minion king kept in his cholar, and propounded vnto him farther, what
of the king of Englands secrets (so aduantageable) he was priuie to,
as might remoue him from the siege of Turwin in three daies. Hee sayde
diuerse, diuerse matters, which askt longer conference, but in good
honestie they were lies, which he had not yet stampt. Heereat the true
king stept forth, and commanded to lay handes on the lozell, and that he
should be tortured to confesse the truth, for he was a spie and nothing
else.

He no sooner sawe the wheele and the torments set before him, but he
cride out like a rascall, and sayde hee was a poore Captaine in the
English camp, suborned by one _Iacke Wilton_ (a noble mans page) and no
other, to come and kill the French king in a brauery and returne, and
that he had no other intention in the world.

This confession could not choose but moue them all to laughter, in that
he made it as light a matter to kill their king and come backe, as to
goe to Islington and eate a messe of creame, and come home againe, nay,
and besides hee protested that he had no other intention, as if that
were not inough to hang him.

_Adam_ neuer fell till God made fooles, all this coulde not keepe his
ioyntes from ransacking on the wheele, for they vowed either to make
him a confessor or a martir in a trice, when still he sung all one song,
they tolde the king he was a foole, and some shrewd head had knauishly
wrought on him, wherefore it should stand with his honour to whip him
out of the campe and send him home. That perswasion tooke place, and
soundly was he lasht out of theyr liberties, and sent home by a Heralde
with this message, that so the king his master hoped to whip home
all the English fooles verie shortly: answere was returned, that that
shortlie, was a long lie, and they were shrewde fooles that shoulde
driue the French man out of his kingdome, and make him glad with
Corinthian _Dionisius_ to play the schoole-master.

The Herald being dismist, our afflicted intelligencer was cald _coram
nobis_, how he spedde, iudge you, but something hee was adiudged to. The
sparowe for his lecherie liueth but a yeere, he for his trecherie was
turnd on the toe, _Plura dolor prohibet_.

Here let me triumph a while, and ruminate a line or two on the
excellence of my wit, but I will not breath neither til I haue
disfraughted all my knauerie.

Another Swizer Captaine that was farre gone for want of the wench, I led
astraie most notoriously, for he beeing a monstrous vnthrift of battle
axes (as one that cared not in his anger to bid flie out scuttels to
fiue score of them) and a notable emboweller of quart pots, I came
disguised vnto him in the forme of a halfe a crowne wench, my gowne and
attire according to the custome the in request. I wis I had my curtesies
in cue or in quart pot rather, for they dyu'd into the very entrailes of
the dust, and I simpered with my countenance lyke a porredge pot on the
fire when it first begins to seeth. The sobrietie of the circumstance
is, that after he had courted me and all, and giuen me the earnest
pennie of impietie, some sixe crownes at the least for an antipast to
iniquitie, I fained an impregnable excuse to be gone, and neuer came at
him after. Yet left I not here, but committed a little more scutcherie.
A companie of coystrell clarkes (who were in band with sathan, and not of
anie souldiers collar nor his hatband) pincht a number of good mindes to
Godward of theyr prouant. They would not let a dram of dead pay ouerslip
them, they would not lend a groat of the weeke to come, to him that had
spent his money before this weeke was done. They outfaced the greatest
and most magnanimious servitours in their sincere and finigraphicall
cleane shirts and cuffes. A lowse that was anie Gentlemans companion
they thought scorne of, their nere bitten beardes must in a deuils name
bedewdeuerie daiewith rosewater, hogges could haue nere a hayre on theyr
backes, for making them rubbing brushes to rouse theyr crab lice. They
woulde in no wise permitte that the moates in the Sunnebeames should be
full mouthde beholders of theyr cleane phinikde appareil, theyr shooes
shined as bright as a slike-stone, theyr handes troubled and soyled more
water with washing, than the camell doth, that nere drinkes till the
whole streame bee troubled. Summarily, neuer anie were so fantastical
the one halfe as they. My masters you may conceiue of me what you list,
but I thinke confidently I was ordayned Gods scourge from aboue for
theyr daintie finicalitie. The houre of theyr punishment could no longer
be proroged, but vengeance must haue at them at al a ventures. So it
was, that the most of these aboue named goosequil braccahadocheos were
meere cowards and crauens, and durst not so much as throw a penfull
of inke into the enimies face, if proofe were made, wherefore on the
experience of their pusellanimitie I thought to raise the foundation
of my roguerie. What did I now but one daie made a false alarum in the
quarter where they laie, to trie how they would stand to theyr tackling,
and with a pittifull outcrie warned them to flie, for there was treason
afoot, they were inuironed and beset. Upon the first watch worde of
treason that was giuen, I thinke they betooke them to theyr heeles verie
stoutly, left theyr penne and inke-hornes and papers behinde them for
spoile, resigned theyr deskes, with the mony that was in them to the
mercie of the vanquisher, and in fine, left mee & my fellowes (their
foole-catchers) Lords of the field: how wee dealt with them, their
disburdened deskes canne best tell, but this I am assured, we fared the
better for it a fortnight of fasting dayes after. I must not place
a volume in the precincts of a pamphlet, sleepe an houre or two, and
dreame that Turney and Turwin is wonne, that the king is shipt againe
into England, and that I am close at harde meate at Windsore or at
Hampton court. What will you in your indifferent opinions allow me for
my trauell, no more seigniorie ouer the Pages than I had before? yes,
whether you will parte with so much probable friendly suppose or no,
He haue it in spite of your heartes. For your instruction and godly
consolation, bee informed, that at that time I was no common squire, no
vndertroden torch-bearer, I had my feather in my cap as big as a flag in
the foretop, my French doublet gelte in the belly as though (lyke a pig
readie to be spitted) all my guts had beene pluckt out, a paire of side
paned hose that hung down like two scales filled with Holland cheeses,
'my long stock that sate close to my docke, and smoothered not a scab
or a leacherous hairie sinew on the calfe of my legge, my rapier pendant
like a round sticke fastned in the tacklings for skippers the better to
climbe by, my cape cloake of blacke cloth, ouerspreading my backe lyke
a thornbacke, or an Elephantes eare, that hanges on his shoulders lyke
a countrie huswiues banskin, which shee thirleth her spindle on, and
in consummation of my curiositie, my handes without gloues, all a more
French, and a blacke budge edging of a beard on the vpper lip, & the
like sable auglet of excrements in the first rising of the anckle of my
chinne. I was the first that brought in the order of passing into the
court which I deriued from the common word _Qui passa_, and the heralds
phrase of armes Passant, thinking in sincerity, hee was not a Gentleman,
nor his armes currant, who was not first past by the pages. If anie
prentise or other came into the court that was not a Gentleman, I
thought it was an indignitie to the preheminence of the court to include
such a one, and could not be salud except we gaue him armes Passant, to
make him a Gentleman. Besides, in Spaine, none compasse anie farre waie
but he must be examined what he is, & giue three pence for his passe. In
which regard it was considered of by the common table of the cupbearers,
what a perilsome thing it was to let anie stranger or outdweller approch
so neere the precincts of the Prince, as the great chamber, without
examining what he was and giuing him his passe, wherevppon we
established the lyke order, but tooke no monie of them as they did,
onelie for a signe that he had not past our hands vnexamined, wee set a
red marke on either of his eares, and so let him walke as authenticall.
I must not discouer what vngodly dealing we had with the blacke iackes,
or how oft I was crowned king of the dronkards with a court cuppe, let
mee quietly descend to the waining of my youthfull dayes, and tell a
little of the sweating sicknesse, that made me in a cold sweate take my
heeles and runne out of England.

This sweating sicknesse, was a disease that a man then might catch and
neuer goe to a hothouse. Many masters desire to haue such semants as
would worke till they sweate againe, but in those dayes he that sweat
neuer wrought againe. That Scripture then was not thought so necessarie,
which sayes, Earne thy liuing with the sweat of thy browes, for then
they earnd their dying with the sweat of their browes. It was inough
if a fat man did but trusse his points, to turne him ouer the pearch:
mother _Cornelius_ tub why it was lyke hell, he that came into it neuer
came out of it Cookes that stande continually basting theirfaces before
the fire, were nowe all cashierd with this sweat into kitchinstuffe:
theyr hall fell in to the kings handes for want of one of the trade to
vpholde it. Feltmakers and furriers, what the one with the hot steame of
their wooll new taken out of the pan, and the other with the contagious
heate of their slaughter budge and connyskins, died more thicke than of
the pestilence: I haue seene an olde woman at that season hauing three
chins, wipe them all away one after another, as they melted to water,
and left her selfe nothing of a mouth but an vpper chap. Looke how in
May or the heat of Summer we lay butter in water for feare it shuld
melte awaie, so then were men faine to wet their clothes in water as
Diers doo, and hide themselues in welles from the heate of the Sunne.

Then happie was he that was an asse, for nothing wyll kill an asse
but colde, and none dide but with extreame heate. The fishes called
Seastarres, that burne one another by excessiue heate, were not so
contagious as one man that had the sweate was to another. Masons paid
nothing for haire to mix their lime, nor giouers to stuffe their balls
with, for then they had it for nothing, it dropt off mens heads and
beardes faster than anie Barber could shaue it. O if haire breeches had
then beene in fashion, what a fine world had it beene for Taylers, and
so it was a fine world for Tailers neuerthelesse, for hee that could
make a garment sleightest and thinnest, carried it awaie. Cutters I
can tell you, then stood vpon it, to haue their trade one of the twelue
Companies, for who was it then that would not haue his doublet cut to
the skin, and his shirt cut into it to, to make it more colde. It was
as much as a mans life was worth, once to name a freeze ierken, it was
treason for a fat grosse man to come within fiue miles of the court,
I heard where they dide vp all in one family, and not a mothers childe
escapt, insomuch as they had but an Irish rug lockt vp in a presse,
and not laide vpon anie bedde neither, if those that were sicke of
this maladie slept on it, they neuer wakt more. Phisitions with their
simples, in this case were simple fellowes, and knew not which way to
bestir them. Galen might goe shop the gander for anie good he could doe,
his secretatyes had so long called him diuine, that now he had lost all
his vertue vpon earth. _Hippocrates_ might well helpe Almanack makers,
but here he had not a worde to saie, a man might sooner catch the sweate
with plodding ouer him to no end, than cure the sweat with any of his
impotent principles. _Paracelsus_ with his spirit of the butterie, and
his spirits of minerals, could not so much as say, God amend him, to the
matter. _Plus erat in artifice quant arte_, there was more infection in
the phisition himselfe than his arte could cure. This mortalitie first
began amongst olde men, for they taking a pride to haue their breasts
loose basted with tedious beards, kept their houses so hot with these
hairy excrements, that not so much but their very wals sweat out salt
Peter, with the smoothering perplexitie, nay a number of them had
meruailous hot breaths, which sticking in the briers of their bushie
beardes, could not choose, but (as close aire long imprisoned) engender
corruption. Wiser was our brother _Bankes_ of these latter dais, who
made his iugling horse a cut, for feare if at anie time hee should
foist, the stinke sticking in his thicke bushie taile might be noisome
to his auditors. Should I tell you how many purseuants with red noses,
and sargeants with precious faces shrunke away in this sweat, you would
not beleeve me. Euen as the Salamander with his very sight blasteth
apples on the trees, so a purseuant or a sargeant at this present, with
the verie reflexe of his fine facias, was able to spoile a man a farre
of. In some places of the world there is no shadow of the sunne, _Diebus
illis_ if it had bene so in England, the generation of _Brute_ had died
all and some. To knit vp this description in a pursuat, so feruent
and scorching was the burning aire which inclosed them, that the most
blessed man then aliue, would haue thoght that God had done fairely by
him, if he had turnde him to a goat, for goates take breath not at the
mouth or nose only, but at y eares also.

Take breath how they would, I vowd to tarrie no longer amongst them. As
at Turwin I was a demie souldier in iest, so now I became a martiallist
in earnest. Ouer sea with my implements I got me, where hearing the king
of France and the Swizers were together by the ears, I made towards them
as fast as I could, thinking to thrust my selfe into that faction that
was strongest It was my good lucke or my ill, I know not which, to come
iust to ye fighting of the battel, where I sawe a wonderfull spectacle
of bloud shed on both sides, here the vnwildie swizers wallowing
in their gore, like an oxe in his doung, there the sprightly French
sprawling and turning on the stayned grasse, like a roach newe taken out
of the streame, all the ground was strewed as thicke with battle axes,
as the carpenters yard with chips. The plaine appeared like a quagmire,
ouerspread as it was with trampled dead bodies. In one place might you
beholde a heape of dead murthered men ouerwhelmed with a falling steed,
in stead of a tombe stone, in another place a bundle of bodies fettered
together in theyr owne bowels, and as the tyrant Romane Empereurs vsed
to tie condemned liuing caitifes face to face to dead corses, so were
the halfe liuing here mixt with squeazed carcases long putrifide. Anie
man might giue armes that was an actor in that battell, for there were
more armes and legs scattered in the field that daie, than will be
gathered vp till dooms daie, the French king himselfe in this conflict
was much distressed, the braines of his owne men sprinkled in his face,
thrice was his courser slaine vnder him, and thrice was hee strucke on
the breast with a speare, but in the end, by the helpe of the Venetians,
the Heluesians or Swizers were subdude, and he crowned victor, a peace
concluded, and the cittie of Millain surrendered vnto him, as a pledge
of reconciliation. That warre thus blowen ouer, and the seueral bands
dissolued, like a crow that still followes aloofe where there is
carrion, I flew me ouer to Munster in Germanie, which an Anabaptisticall
brother named _Iohn Leiden_ kepte at that instant against the Emperor
and the Duke of Saxonie. Here I was in good hope to set vp my staffe for
some reasonable time, deeming that no Citie would driue it to a
siege except they were able to holde out, and pretily well had these
Munsterians held out, for they kept the Emperour and the Duke of Saxonie
sound plaie for the space of a yeere, and longer wold haue done, but
that dame famine came amongst them, wherevppon they were forst by
messengers to agree vpon a daie of fight, when according to theyr
anabaptisticall errour they might be all new christned in theyr owne
bloud.

That daie come, flourishing entered _lohn Leiden_ the botcher into the
field, with a scarfe made of lists, like a bowcase, a crosse on his
brest like a thred bottom, a round twilted Tailers cushion buckled lyke
a tancard bearers deuice to his shoulders for a target, the pike whereof
was a packe needle, a tough prentises club for his speare, a great
brewers cow on his back for a corslet, and on his head for a helmet
a huge high shoo with the bottome turnd vpward, embossed as full of
hobnailes as euer it might sticke, his men were all base handie craftes,
as coblers, and curriers, and tinkers, whereof some had barres of yron,
some hatchets, some coole staues, some dung forks, some spades, some
mattockes, some wood kniues, some addsses for theyr weapons, he that was
best prouided, had but a peece of a rustie browne bill brauely fringed
with cobwebbes to fight for him: perchance here and there you might see
a felow that had a canker eaten seul on his head, which serued him and
his ancestors for a chamber pot two hundred yeeres, and another that had
bent a couple of yron dripping pans armourwise, to fence his backe
and his belly, another that had thrust a payre of dry olde bootes as a
breast plate before his belly of his doublet, because he would not
be dangerously hurt: another that had twilted all his trusse full of
counters, thinking if the enemie shoulde take him, he would mistake them
for golde, and so saue his life for his money. Very deuout asses they
were, for all they were so dunstically set forth, & such as thought
they knew as much of Gods minde as richer men, why inspiration was their
ordinarie familiar, and buzde in theyr eares like a Bee in a boxe euerie
houre what newes from heauen, hell, and the lands of whipperginnie,
displease them who durst, hee shoulde have his mittimus to damnation _ex
tempore_, they woulde vaunt there was not a pease difference twixt them
and the Apostles, they were as poore as they, of as base trades as they,
and no more inspired than they, and with God there is no respect of
persons, onely herein may seeme some little diuersitie to lurke, that
_Peter_ wore a sword, and they count it flat hel fire for anie man to
weare a dagger, nay so grounded and grauelled were they in this opinion,
that now when they should come to battel, thers nere a one of them wold
bring a blade (no not an onion blade) about him, to die for it It
was not lawfull sayde they, for anie man to draw the sworde but the
magistrate, and in fidelitie (which I had welnigh forgot) _Iacke Leiden_
theyr magistrate had the image or likenesse of a peece of a rustie sword
like a lusty lad by his side, now I remember me, it was but a foile
neither, and he wore it, to shew that he should haue the foile of his
enemies, which might haue bin an oracle for his twohande interpretation.
_Quid plura_, his battell is pitcht, by pitcht, I do not meane set in
order, for that was far from their order, onely as sailers do pitch
their appareil, to make it stormeproofe, so had most of them pitcht
their patcht clothes, to make them impearceable. A neerer way than to
be at the charges of armor by halfe: and in another sort hee might
bee sayde to haue pitcht y field, for he had pitcht or set vp his rest
whither to flie if they were discomfited. Peace, peace there in the
belfrie, seruice begins, vpon their knees before they ioyne, fals _Iohn
Leiden_ and his fraternitie verie deuoutly, they pray, they houle, they
expostulate with God to grant them victory, and vse such vnspeakable
vehemence, a man would thinke them the onely well bent men vtider
heauen, wherein let mee dilate a little more grauely than the nature of
this historie requires, or will be expected of so young a practitioner
in diuinitie: that not those that intermissiuely cry, Lord open vnto us,
Lord open vnto us, enter first into the kingdome of heauen, that not the
greatest professors haue the greatest portion in grace, that all is
not golde that glisters. When Christ sayd, the kingdome of heauen must
suffer violence, hee meant not the violence of long babling praiers to
no purpose, nor the violence of tedious inuective sermons without wit,
but the violence of faith, the violence of good works, the violence of
patient suffering. The ignorant arise and snatch the kingdome of heauen
to themselues with greedines, when we with all our learning sinke downe
into hell. Where did _Peter_ and _Iohn_ in the third of the Acts, finde
the lame cripple but in the gate of the temple called beautifull, in the
beautifullest gates of our temple, in the forefront of professors, are
many lame cripples, lame in lyfe, lame in good workes, lame in euerie
thing, yet will they alwayes sit at the gates of the temple, none be
more forwarde tha they to enter into matters of reformation, yet none
more behinde hand to enter into the true temple of the Lord by the gates
of good life. You may obiect, that those which I speak against, are
more diligent in reading the scriptures, more carefull to resort vnto
sermons, more sober in their lookes and modest in their attire than anie
else: but I praie you let me aunswere you, Doth not Christ saie, that
before the latter daie the Sunne shall be turned into darknes, & the
Moone into bloud, whereof what may the meaning be, but that the
glorious sun of the gospell shall be eclipsed with the dun cloude of
dissimulation, that that which is the brightest planet of saluation,
shall be a meanes of errour and darknes: and the moone shal be turned
into bloud, those that shine fairest, make the simplest shew, seeme most
to fauour religion, shall rent out the bowels of the Church, be turned
into bloud, and all this shall come to passe, before the notable daie
of the Lord, whereof this age is the eue. Let me vse a more familiar
example since the heate of a great number hath outraged so excessiuely.
Did not the deuill leade Christ to the pinacle or highest part of the
temple to tempt him, if he lead Christ, he wil leade a whole armie of
hypocrites to the toppe or highest part of the temple, the highest step
of religion and holines, to seduce them and subuert them. I say vnto you
that which this our tempted sauiour with many other words besought his
disciples, saue your selues from this froward generation. Verily, verily
the seruaunt is not greater than his master: verily, verily, sinful
men are not holier than holy Jesus their maker. That holy Jesus againe
repeats this holy sentence, Remember the wordes I sayde vnto you, the
seruant is not holier or greater than his master, as if he should say,
remember then, imprint in your memorie your pride and singularitie will
make you forget them, the effectes of them many yeeres hence will
come to passe. Whosoeuer will seeke to saue his soule shall loose it
Whosoeuer seekes by headlong meanes to enter into heauen, & disanull
Gods ordinance, shal with y gyants that thought to scale heauen in
contempt of Jupiter, be ouerwhelmed with mount Ossa & Pelion, & dwel
with the deuill in eternal desolation. Though the high priests office
was expired, when _Paul_ said vnto one of them, God rebuke thee thou
painted sepulchre, yet when a stander by reproued him saying, Reuilest
thou the high priest? he repented & askt forgiuenesse. That which I
suppose I doe not grant, the lawfulnes of the authoritie they oppose
themselues agaynst, is sufficiently proued, farre bee it my vnderage
argumentes should intrude themselues as a greene weake prop to support
so high a building, let it suffice, if you knowe Christ, you know his
father also, if you know Christianitie, you know the Fathers of the
Church also, but a greate number of you with _Philip_ haue bene long
with Christ, and haue not knowen him, haue long professed your selues
Christians, and not knowen his true ministers, you follow the French and
Scotitsh fashion and faction, and in all pointes are lyke the Swizers,
_Qui quorunt cum qua gente cadunt_, that seeke with what nation they may
first miscarrie.

In the dayes of _Nero_ there was an odde fellowe that had found out an
exquisite waie to make glasse as hammer proofe as golde: shall I saie,
that the like experiment he made vppon glasse, we haue practised on the
Gospell? I, confidently will I, we haue found out a slight to hammer it
to anie heresie whatsoeuer, but those furnaces of falshood and hammer
heads of heresie must be dissolued and broken as his was, or els I feare
me the false glittering glasse of innouation will bee better esteemed of
than the ancient gold of the gospell. The fault of faults is this, that
your dead borne faith is begotten by to too infant fathers. _Cato_ one
of the wisest men Roman histories canonized, was not borne till his
father was foure score yeeres olde, none can be a perfect father
of faith and beget men aright vnto God, but those that are aged in
experience, haue many yeres imprinted in their milde conuersation, and
haue with Zaclteus sold all their possessions of vanities, to inioy the
sweet fellowshippe, not of the humane but spirituall messias. Ministers
and pastors sell awaie your sects and schismes to the decrepite Churches
in contention beyond sea, they haue bene so long inured to warre both
about matters of religion and regiment, that now they haue no peace of
minde, but in troubling all other mens peace. Because the pouertie of
their prouinces will allow them no proportionable maintenance for higher
callings of ecclesiasticall magistrates, they would reduce vs to the
president of their rebellious persecuted beggerie: much like the sect
of philosophers called cinikes, who when they saw they were borne to
no lands or possessions, nor had anie possible meanes to support their
desperate estates, but they must liue despised and in miserie doe what
they could, they plotted and consulted with themselues howe to make
theyr pouertie better esteemed of than rich dominion and soueraigntie.
The vpshot of their plotting and consultation was this, that they would
liue to themselues, scorning the verie breath or conipanie of all men,
they profest (according to y rate of their lands) voluntarie pouerty,
thin fare and lying hard, contemning and inueighing against al those
as brute beasts whatsoeuer whom the world had giuen anie reputation for
riches or prosperitie. _Diogenes_ was one of the first and fonnost of
the ringleaders of this rustie morositie, and he for all his nice
dogged disposition, and blunt deriding of worldly drosse, and the grosse
felycitie of fooles, was taken notwithstanding a little after verie
fairely coining monie in his cell: so fares it vp and down with our
cinicall reformed forraine Churches, they will disgest no grapes of great
Bishoprikes forsooth, because they cannot tell how to come by them, they
must shape their cotes good men according to their cloth, and doe as
they may, not as they woulde, yet they must giue vs leaue heere in
England that are their honest neighbours, if wee haue more cloth than
they, to make our garment somewhat larger. What was the foundation or
groundworke of this dismall declining of Munster, but the banishing of
their Bishop, their confiscating and casting lots for Church liuings,
as the souldiers cast lots for Christes garments, and in short tearmes,
theyr making the house of God a den of theeues. The house of God a number
of hungry church robbers in these dayes haue made a den of theeues.
Theeues spend loosely what they haue got lightly, sacriledge is no sure
inheritance, _Dionisius_ was nere the richer for robbing _Iupiter_ of
his golden coate, he was driuen in the end to play the schoolmaster at
Corinth. The name of religion, be it good or bad that is ruinated, God
neuer suffers vnreuenged, He say of it as _Ouid_ sayd of Eunuchs:

_Qui primus pueris genitalia membra recidit Vulnera qua fecit deduit
ipse pati._

     Who first depriude yong boies of their best part,
     With selfe same wounds he gaue he ought to smart.

So would he that first gelt religion or Churchliuings had bin first gelt
himselfe or neuer liued, Cardinall _Wolsey_ is the man I aime at, _Qui
in suas ponas ingeniosus erat_, first gaue others a light to his owne
ouerthrow. How it prospered with him and his instruments that after
wrought for themselues, Chronicles largely report, though not apply, and
some parcel of their punishment yet vnpaid, I doe not doubt but will bee
required of their posteritie.

To go forward with my storie of the ouerthrowe of that vsurper _Iohn
Leiden_, he and all his armie (as I saide before) falling prostrate on
their faces, and ferquently giuen ouer to praier, determined neuer to
cease, or leaue soliciting of God, till he had shewed them from heauen
some manifest miracle of successe. Note that it was a general receiued
tradition both with _I. Leiden_ and all the crue of Cnipper-dolings and
Muncers, if God at anie time at their vehement outcries and clamors did
not condiscend to their requests, to raile on him and curse him to his
face, to dispute with him, and argue him of iniustice, for not being
so good as his word with them, and to vrge his many promises in the
scripture against him: so that they did not serue God simply, but that
hee shoulde serue their turnes, and after that tenure are many content
to serue as bondmen to saue the danger of hanging: but he that serues
God aright, whose vpright conscience hath for his mot, _Amor est miki
causa sequendi_, I serue because I loue: he saies, _Ego te potius domine
quam tua dona sequar_, He rather follow thee O Lord, for thine owne
sake, than for anie couetous respect of that thou canst do for me,
Christ would haue no folowers, but such as forsooke all and follow him,
such as forsake all their owne desires, such as abandon all expectations
of rewarde in this world, such as neglected and contemned their liues,
their wiues and children in comparison of him, and were content to take
vp their crosse and folow him. These Anabaptists had not yet forsooke
all and followed Christ, they had not forsooke their owne desires of
reuenge and innouation, they had not abandoned their expectation of the
spoile of their enimies, they regarded their liues, they lookt after
their wiues & children, they tooke not vp their crosse of humilitie and
followed him, but would crosse him, vpbraid him, and set him at naught,
if he assured not by some signe their praiers and supplications.
_Deteriora sequuntur_, they folowed God as daring him. God heard their
praiers, _Quod petitur poena est_, It was their speedie punishment
that they praide for. Lo according to the summe of their impudent
supplications, a signe in the heauens appeard the glorious signe of the
rainbow, which agreed iust with the signe of their ensigne that was a
rainbowe likewise. Wherevpon assuring themselues of victorie, (_Miseri
quod volunt facile credunt_) that which wretches woulde haue they easily
beleeue. With shoutes and clamours they presentlie ranne headlong
on theyr well deserued confusion. Pittifull and lamentable was their
vnpittied and well performed slaughter. To see euen a Beare (which
is the most cruellest of all beastes) to too bloudily ouermatcht, and
deformedly rent in peeces by an vnconscionable number of curres, it
woulde moue compassion against kinde, and make those that beholding him
at the stake yet vncoapte with, wisht him a sutable death to his vgly
shape, now to recall their hard hearted wishes, and moane him suffering
as a mild beast, in comparison of the foule mouthed mastifes his
butchers: euen such compassion dyd those ouermatcht vngratious
Munsterians obtayne of many indifferent eyes, who now thought them
suffering, to bee as sheepe brought innocent to the shambles, when as
before they deemed them as a number of wolues vp in armes agaynst the
shepheardes. The Emperyalles themselues that were theyr executioners
(lyke a Father that weepes when he beates his child, yet still weepes
and still beates) not without much ruth and sorrow prosecuted that
lamentable massacre, yet drumms and trumpets sounding nothing but
stearne reuenge in their eares, made them so eager, that their hands
had no leasure to aske counsell of theyr effeminate eyes, theyr swords,
theyr pikes, theyr bils, their bows, their caleeuers flew, empierced,
knockt downe, shot thorough, and ouerthrew as many men euerie minute of
the battell, as there fais eares of corne before the sithe at one blowe,
yet all theyr weapons so slaying, empiercing, knocking downe, shooting
through, ouerthrowing, dissouleioyned not halfe so many, as the hailing
thunder of their great ordenance so ordinary at euerie footstep was the
imbrument of iron in bloud, that one could hardly discerne heads from
bullettes, or clottered haire from mangled flesh hung with gore. This
tale must at one time or other giue vp the ghost, and as good now as
stay longer, I would gladly rid my hands of it cleanly if I could tell
how, for what with talking of coblers, & tinkers, & roapemakers, and
botchers, and durt-daubers, the marke is cleane gone out of my muses
mouth, and I am as it were more than dunsified twixt divinitie and
poetrie. What is there more as touching this tragedie that you would be
resolued of? saie quickly, for now my pen is got vpon his feet again:
how _I. Leiden_ dide, is y it? he dide like a dog, he was hanged and the
halter paid for. For his companions, do they trouble you? I can tel you
they troubled some men before, for they were all kild, and none escapt,
no not so much as one to tel the tale of the rainbow. Heare what it is
to be Anabaptists, to bee puritans, to be villaines, you may be counted
illuminate botchers for a while, but your end wil be Good people pray
for me.

With the tragicall catastrophe of this munsterian conflict, did I
cashier the new vocation of my caualiership. There was no more honorable
wars in christendome then towards, wherefore after I had learned to
be halfe an houre in bidding a man _boniure_ in germane sunonimas, I
trauelled along the cuntrie towards England as fast as I could. What
with wagons & bare tentoes hauing attained to Middleborough (good Lord
see the changing chances of vs knight arrant infants) I met with the
right honourable Lord _Henrie Howard_ Earle of Surrey my late master,
Jesu I was perswaded.

I shoulde not be more glad to see heauen than I was to see him, O it was
a right noble Lord, liberalitie itselfe, (if in this yron age there were
anie such creature as liberality left on the earth) a prince in content
because a Poet without peere. Destinie neuer defames her selfe but
when she lets an excellent poet die: if there bee anie sparke of Adams
paradized perfection yet emberd vp in the breastes of mortall men,
certainely God hath bestowed that his perfectest image on poets. None
come so neere to God in wit, none more contemne the world, _vatis auarus
non temere est animus, sayth Horace, versus amat, hoc studet vnurn_.
Seldom haue you seene anie Poet possessed with auarice, onely verses he
loues, nothing else he delights in: and as they contemne the world, so
contrarily of the mechanicall worlde are none more contemned. Despised
they are of the worlde, because they are not of the world: their
thoughts are exalted aboue the worlde of ignorance and all earthly
conceits.

As sweet angelicall queristers they are continually conuersant in the
heauen of artes, heauen it selfe is but the highest height of knowledge,
he that knowes himselfe & all things else, knowes the means to be
happie: happy, thrice happie are they whome God hath doubled his spirite
vppon, and giuen a double soule vnto to be Poets. My heroicall master
exceeded in this supernaturall kinde of wit, hee entertained no grosse
earthly spirite of auarice, nor weake womanly spirit of pusillanimity
and feare that are fained to be of the water, but admirable, airie, and
firie spirites, full of freedome, magnanimitie and bountihood. Let me
not speake anie more of his accomplishments, for feare I spend al my
spirits in praising him and leaue my selfe no vigor of wit, or effectes
of a soule to goe forward with my history. Hauing thus met him I so much
adored, no interpleading was there of opposite occasions, but backe I
must returne and beare halfe stakes with him in the lotterie of
trauell. I was not altogether vnwilling to walke along with such a good
purse-bearer, yet musing what changeable humor had so sodainly seduced
him from his natiue soyle to seeke out needlesse perils in these parts
beyond sea, one night verie boldly I demaunded of him the reason that
moued him thereto.

Ah quoth he, my little Page, full little canst thou perceiue howe farre
metamorphozed I am from my selfe, since I last sawe thee. There is
a little God called Loue, that will not bee worshipt of anie leaden
braines, one that proclaimes himselfe sole king and Emperour of pearcing
eyes and chiefe soueraigtie of softe heartes, hee it is that exercising
his empire in my eyes, hath exorcized and cleane coniured me from my
content. Thou knowest stately _Geraldine_, too stately I feare for me to
doe homage to her statue or shrine, she it is that is come out of Italy
to bewitch all the wise men of England, vpon Queene _Katherine Dowager_
shee waites, that hath a dowrie of beautie sufficient to make her wooed
of the greatest kings in christendome. Her high exalted sunne beames
haue set the phenix neast of my breast on fire, and I my selfe haue
brought Arabian spiceries of sweete passions and praises, to furnish out
the funerall flame of my folly. Those who were condemned to be smothered
to death by sinking downe into the softe bottome of an high built bedde
of roses, neuer dide so sweete a death as I shoulde die, if her rose
coloured disdaine were my deathsman. Oh thrice emperiall Hampton court,
_Cupids_ inchaunted castle, the place where I first sawe the perfect
omnipotence of the Almightie expressed in mortalitie, tis thou alone,
that tithing all other men solace in thy pleasant scituation, affoordest
mee nothing but an excellent begotten sorrowe out of the chiefe
treasurie of all thy recreations.

Deare _Wilton_, vnderstand that there it was where I first set eie on my
more than celestiall Geraldine. Seeing her I admired her, all the whole
receptacle of my sight was vnhabited with her rare worth. Long sute and
vncessant protestations got me the grace to be entertained. Did neuer
vnlouing seruant so prentiselike obey his neuer pleased mistres, as
I dyd her. My lyfe, my wealth, my friendes, had all theyr destinie
depending on her command. Uppon a time I was determined to trauell, the
fame of Italy, and an especiall affection I had vnto Poetrie my second
mistres, for which Italy was so famous, had wholy rauisht mee vnto it
There was no dehortment from it, but needes thether I woulde, wherefore
comming to my mistres as she was then walking with other Ladyes of
estate in paradice at Hampton court, I most humblie besought her of
fauour, that shee would giue me so much gracious leaue to absent my
selfe from her seruice, as to trauell a yeare or two in Italy. She verie
discreetly aunswered mee, that if my loue were so hot as I had often
auouched, I dyd verie well to applie the plaister of absence vnto it,
for absence, as they saie, causeth forgetfulnesse, yet neuerthelesse
since it is Italy my natiue Countrie you are so desirous to see, I am
the more willing to make my will yours: _I pete Italiam_, go and seeke
Italie with Aenoas, but bee more true than _Aenoas_, I hope that kinde
wit-cherishing climate will worke no change in so wittie a breast. No
countrie of mine shall it be more, if it conspire with thee, in anie
newe loue agaynst mee. One charge I will giue thee, and let it bee
rather a request than a charge: When thou commest to Florence (the fayre
Citie from whence I fetcht the pride of my birth) by an open challenge
defende my beautie agaynst all commers.

Thou hast that honourable carryage in armes, that it shall bee no
discredite for mee to bequeath all the glorie of my beautie to thy well
gouerned arme. Faine woulde I be knowen where I was borne, fayne woulde
I haue thee knowen where fame sits in her chiefest theater. Farewell,
forget mee not, continued deserts will eternize me vnto thee, thy full
wishes shall bee expired when thy trauell shall be once ended.

Heere dyd teares steppe out before wordes, and intercepted the course
of my kinde concerned speech, euen as winde is allayed with raine: with
heart scalding sighes I confirmed her parting request, and vowed my
selfe hers, while liuing heate allowed mee to bee mine owne, _Hinc illo
lachrimo_ heere hence proceedeth the whole cause of my peregrination.

Not a litle was I delighted with this vnexpected loue story, especially
from a mouth out of which was nought wont to march but sterne precepts
of grauitie and modestie. I sweare vnto you I thought his companie
the better by a thousande crownes, because he had discarded those nice
tearmes of chastitie and continencie. Now I beseech God loue me so well
as I loue a plain dealing man, earth is earth, flesh is flesh, earth
wil to earth, and flesh vnto flesh, fraile earth, fraile flesh, who can
keepe you from the worke of your creation.

Dismissing this fruitlesse annotation _pro et contra_, towards Venice we
progrest, & tooke Roterdam in our waie, that was cleane out of our waie,
there wee met with aged learninges chiefe ornament, that abundant and
superingenious clarke _Erasmus_, as also with merrie sir _Thomas Moore_
our Countrieman, who was come purposely ouer a little before vs, to
visite the sayd graue father _Erasmus_: what talk, what conference we
had then, it were heere superfluous to rehearse, but this I can
assure you, _Erasmus_ in al his speeches seemed so much to mislike the
indiscretion of princes in preferring of parasites & fooles, that
he decreed with himselfe to swim with the streame, and write a booke
forthwith in commendation of folly. Quick witted sir _Thomas
Moore_ traueld in a cleane contrarie prouince, for hee seeing most
commonwealths corrupted by ill custome, & that principalities were
nothing but great piracies, which gotten by violence and murther, were
maintained by priuate vndermining and bloudshed, that in the chiefest
flourishing kingdomes there was no equal or wel diuided weale one with
another, but a manifest conspiracie of rich men against poore men,
procuring their owne vnlawfull commodities vnder the name and interest
of the commonwealth: he concluded with himselfe to lay downe a perfect
plot of a commonwealth or gouernment, which he would intitle his
_Vtopia_. So lefte wee them to prosecute their discontented studies, &
made our next iourney to Wittenberg.

At the verie point of our enterance into Wittenberg, wee were spectators
of a verie solemne scolasticall entertainment of the Duke of Saxonie
thether. Whome because he was the chiefe patrone of their vniuersitie,
and had tooke _Luthers_ parte in banishing the masse and all lyke papall
Jurisdiction out of their towne, they croucht vnto extreamly. The chiefe
ceremonies of their entertainment were these: first, the heads of their
vniuersitie, (they were great heads of certaintie) met him in their
hooded hypocrisie and doctorly accoustrement, _secundum formam statuti_,
where by the Orator of the vniuersitie, whose pickerdeuant was very
plentifully besprinkled with rose water, a verie learned or rather
ruthfull Oration was deliuered (for it raind all the while) signifieng
thus much, that it was al by patch and by peecemeale stolne out of
_Tully_, & he must pardon them, though in emptying their phrase bookes,
the ayre emptied his intrailes, for they did it not in anie ostentation
of wit (which they had not) but to shewe the extraordinarie good will
they bare the Duke, (to haue him stand in the raine tyll he was thorough
wet) a thousand _quernadmodums_ and _quapropters_ he came ouer him with,
euery sentence he concluded with _Esse posse videatur_: through all the
nine worthies he ran with praising and comparing him, _Nestors_ yeares
hee assured him off vnder the broade seale of their supplications, and
with that crowe troden verse in Virgil, _Dum iuga montis aper_, hee
packt vp his pipes, and cride _dixi_.

That pageant ouerpast, there rusht vpon him a miserable rabblement of
iunior graduats, that all crid out vpon him mightily in their gibrige
lyke a companie of beggers, God saue your grace, God saue your grace,
Jesus preserue your highnes, though it be but for an houre.

Some three halfe pennyworth of Latine here also had he throwen at his
face, but it was choise stuffe I can tell you, as there is a choise euen
amongest ragges gathered vp from the dunghill. At the townes end met
him the burgers and dunstical incorporationers of Wittenberg in their
distinguished liueries, their distinguished liuerie faces I mene, for
they were most of them hot liuered dronkards, and had all the coate
coulours of sanguin, purple, crimson, copper, carnation that were to be
had in their countenaunces. Filthy knaues, no cost had they bestowed
on the town for his welcome, sauing new painted their houghs & bousing
houses, which commonly are built fayrer than their Churches, and ouer
their gates set the town armes, which sounded gulping after this sort,
_Vanhotten, slotten, irk bloshen glotten gelderslike_: what euer the
wordes were, the sense was this, Good drinke is a medicine for all
diseases.

A bursten belly inkhorne orator called _Vanderhulke_ they pickt out to
present him with an oration, one that had a sulpherous big swolne large
face, like a Saracen, eies lyke two kentish oysters, a mouth that opened
as wide euerie time hee spake, as one of those olde knit trap doores, a
beard as though it had bin made of a birds neast pluckt in peeces, which
consisteth of strawe, haire, and durt mixt together. Hee was apparelled
in blacke leather new licourd, and a short gowne without any gathering
in the backe, faced before and behind with a boistrous Beare skinne,
and a red nightcap on his head. To this purport and effecte was this
broccing double beere Oration.

Right noble Duke (_ideo nobilis quasi nobilis_) for you haue no bile or
cholar in you, know that our present incorporation of Wittenberg, by
me the tongue-man of their thankfulnes, a townesman by birth, a free
Germane by nature, an oratour by arte, and a scriuener by education,
in all obedience & chastity, most bountifully bid you welcome to
Wittenberg: welcome sayde I? O orificiall rethorike wipe thy euerlasting
mouth, and affoord me a more Indian metaphor than that, forthe braue
princely bloud of a Saxon. Oratorie vncaske the hard hutch of thy
complements, and with the triumphantest troupe in thy treasurie doe
trewage vnto him. What impotent speech with his eight partes may not
specifie this vnestimable guift holding his peace, shall as it were
(with teares I speake it) do wherby as it may seeme or appeare, to
manifest or declare & yet it is, & yet it is not, & yet it may bee a
diminitiue oblation meritorious to your high pusillanimitie & indignity.
Why shoulde I goe gadding and fisgigging after firking flantado
Amphibologies, wit is wit, and good will is good will. With all the wit
I haue, I here according to the premises, offer vp vnto you the Cities
generall good will, which is a guilded Canne, in manner and forme
following, for you and the heires of your bodie lawfully begotten, to
drinke healths in. The scolasticall squitter bookes clout you vp
cannopies & footclothes of verses. Wee that are good fellowes, and liue
as merrie as cup and can, will not verse vpon you as they do, but must
doe as we can, and entertaine you if it bee but with a playne emptie
Canne. He hath learning inough that hath learnd to drinke to his first
man.

Gentle Duke, without paradox be it spoken, thy horses at your owne
proper costs and charges shall kneed vp to the knees all the while thou
art here in spruce beere & lubeck licour. Not a dog thou bringst with
thee but shall be banketted with rhenish wine and sturgion. On our
shoulders we weare no lamb skin or miniuer like these academikes, yet
wee can drinke to the confusion of all thy enemies. Good lambes-wooll
haue we for their lambe skins, and for their miniuer, large minerals in
our coffers. Mechanicall men they call vs, and not amisse, for most of
vs being _Mochi_, yt is, cuckolds & whooremasters, fetch our antiquitie
from the temple of _Mocha_, where Mahomet is hung vp. Three parts of the
world, America, Affrike and Asia, are of this our mechanike religion.
_Nero_ when he crid _O quantus artifex pereo_, profest himselfe of our
freedome. Insomuch as _Artifex_ is a citizen or craftsman, as wel as
_Carnifex_ a scholler or hangman. Passe on by leaue into the precincts
of our abhomination. Bony Duke, frolike in our bowse, and perswade thy
selfe that euen as garlike hath three properties, to make a man winke,
drinke, and stinke, so wee wyll winke on thy imperfections, drinke to
thy fauorites, & all thy foes shall stinke before vs. So be it Farewell.

The Duke laught not a little at this ridiculous oration, but that verie
night, as great an ironicall occasion was ministred, for he was
bidden to one of the chiefe schoolesto a Comedie handled by scollers.
_Acolastus_ the prodigall childe was the name of it, which was so
filthily acted, so leathernly sette foorth, as woulde haue moued
laughter in _Heraclitus_. One as if he had beene playning a clay floore
stampingly troade the stage so harde with his feete, that I thought
verily he had resolued to doe the Carpenter that sette it vp some vtter
shame. Another floung his armes lyke cudgelles at a peare tree, in so
much as it was mightily dreaded that hee woulde strike the candles that
hung aboue theyr heades out of their sockets, and leaue them all darke.
Another did nothing but winke and make faces. There was a parasite, &
he with clapping his hands and thripping his fingers seemed to dance
an antike to and fro The onely thing they did well, was the prodigal
childes hunger, most of their schollers being hungerly kept, and surely
you would haue sayd they had ben brought vp in hogs academie to learne
to eate acornes, if you had seene how sedulously they fell to them. Not
a iest had they to keepe their auditors from sleepe but of swill and
draffe, yes now and then the seruant put his hand into the dish before
his master, and almost choakt himselfe, eating slouenly and rauenously
to cause sport.

The next daie they had solempne disputations, where _Luther_ and
_Carolostadius_ scolded leuell coile. A masse of words I wot well they
heapt vp against the masse and the Pope, but farther perticulars of
their disputations I remember not. I thought verily they woulde haue
worried one another with wordes, they were so earnest and vehement.
_Luther_ had the louder voice, _Carolostadius_ went beyond him in
beating and bounsing with his fists, _Quæ supra nos nihil ad nos_. They
vttered nothing to make a man laugh, therefore I wil leaue them. Mary
theyr outward iestures now and then would affoorde a man a morsell of
mirth: of those two I meane not so much, as of all the other traine of
opponents and respondents. One peckte like a crane with his forefinger
at euery halfe sillable he brought forth, and nodded with his nose like
an olde singing man, teaching a yong querister to keepe time. Another
would be sure to wipe his mouth with his handkercher at the end of
euerie full point And euer when he thought he had cast a figure
so curiously, as he diu'de ouer head and eares into his auditors
admiration, hee would take occasion to stroke vp his haire, and twine
vp his mustachios twice or thrice ouer while they might haue leasure
to applaud him. A third wauerd and wagled his head, like a proud horse
playing with his bridle, or as I haue seene some fantasticall swimmer,
at euerie stroke, traine his chin sidelong ouer his left shoulder. A
fourth swet and foamed at the mouth, for verie anger his aduersarie
had denied that part of his sillogisme which he was not prepared to
aunswere. A fifth spread his armes like an vsher that goes before to
make roome, and thript with his finger & his thumbe when he thought he
had tickled it with a conclusion. A sixt hung downe his countenance lyke
a sheepe, and stutted and slauered verie pittifully when his inuention
was stept aside out of the waie. A seuenth gaspt and gapt for winde,
and groned in his pronunciation as if he were hard bound in some bad
argument. Grosse plodders they were all, that had some learning and
reading, but no wit to make vse of it They imagined the Duke tooke the
greatest pleasure and contentment vnder heauen to heare them speak.
Latine, and as long as they talkt nothing but _Tully_ he was bound to
attend them. A most vaine thing it is in many vniuersities at this daye,
that they count him excellent eloquent, who stealeth not whole phrases
but whole pages out of _Tully_. If of a number of shreds of his
sentences he can shape an oration, from all the world hee carries
it awaie, although in truth it be no more than a fooles coat of many
coulours. No inuention or matter haue they of theyr owne, but tacke vp
a stile of his stale galimafries. The leaden headed Germanes first began
this, and we Englishmen haue surfetted of their absurd imitation. I
pittie _Nizolius_ that had nothing to doe, but picke thrids ends out of
an olde ouerworne garment. This is but by the waie, we must looke backe
to our disputants. One amongst the rest thinking to be more conceited
than his fellowes, seeing the Duke haue a dog hee loued well, which sate
by him on the tarras, conuerted all his oration to him, and not a haire
of his taile but he kembd out with comparisons. So to haue courted
him if he were a bitch had bin verie suspitious. Another commented
& descanted on the Dukes staffe, new tipping it with many queint
epithites. Some cast his natiuitie, and promised him he should not
die till the daie of Judgement Omitting further superfluities of this
stampe, in this general assembly we found intermixed that abundant
scholler _Cornelius Agrippa_. At that time he bare the fame to be the
greatest coniurer in Christendome. _Scoto_ that did the iugling trickes
here before the Queene, neuer came neere him one quarter in magicke
reputation. The Doctors of Wittenberg doting on the rumour that went
of him, desired him before the Duke and them to doe something
extraordinarie memorable.

One requested to see pleasant _Plautus_, & that he would shew them
in what habite hee went, and with what countenaunce he lookt, when he
ground corne in the mill. Another had halfe a moneths minde to _Ouid_
and his hooke nose. _Erasmus_ who was not wanting to that honourable
meeting, requested to see _Tully_ in that same grace and maiestie he
pleaded his Oration _pro Roscio Amerino_. Affirming, that til in person
he beheld his importunitie of pleading, he woulde not be perswaded anie
man coulde carrie awaie a manifest case with rethorike, so straungely.
To _Erasmus_ petition he easily condiscended, and willing the Doctours
at such an houre to holde theyr conuocation, and euerie one to keepe him
in his place without mouing: at the time prefixed in entered _Tully_,
ascended his pleading place, and declaimed verbatim the fornamed
Oration, but with such astonishing amazement, with such feruent
exaltation of spirite, with such soule-stirring iestures, that all his
auditours were readie to install his guiltie client for a God.

Greate was the concourse of glorie _Agrippa_ drewe to him with this one
feate. And in deede hee was so cloyed with men which came to beholde
him, that hee was fayne sooner than hee woulde, to returne to the
Emperours court from whence hee came, and leaue Wittenberg before hee
woulde. With him we trauelled along, hauing purchast his acquaintance a
little before. By the waie as wee went, my master and I agreed to change
names. It was concluded betwixte vs, that I shoulde bee the Earle of
Surrie, and hee my man, onely because in his owne person, which hee
woulde not haue reproched, he meant to take more libertie of behauiour.
As for my carryage hee knew hee was to tune it at a key, eyther high or
low, or as hee list.

To the Emperours Court wee came, where our entertainment was euerie waie
plentifull, carouses wee had in whole galons in stead of quart pots. Not
a health was giuen vs but contayned well neere a hogshead. The customes
of the Countrie we were eager to be instructed in, but nothing we coulde
learne but this, that euer at the Emperours coronation there is an Oxe
roasted with a stagge in the belly, and that stagge in his belly hath a
kidde, and that kidde is stufte full of birdes. Some courtiers to wearie
out time woulde tell vs further tales of _Cornelius Agrippa_, and how
when sir _Thomas Moore_ our countrieman was there, hee shewed him the
whole destruction of Troy in a dreame. How the Lorde _Cromwell_ being
the kings Embassador there, in lyke case, in a perspectiue glasse he set
before his eyes, King Henrie the eight with all his Lordes hunting in
his forrest at Windsore, and when he came into his studie, and was verie
vrgent to be partaker of some rare experiment, that he might report when
he came into England, he wilde him amongst two thousande great bookes to
take downe which he list, and begin to reade one line in anie place, and
without booke he woulde rehearse twentie leaues following. _Cromwell_
dyd so, and in manye bookes tride him, when in euerie thing hee exceeded
his promise and conquered his expectation. To _Charles_ the fifte
then Emperour, they reported how he shewed the nine worthies, _Dauid,
Salomon, Gedeon_, and the rest, in that similitude and lykenesse that
they liued vpon earth. My master and I hauing by the high waie side
gotten some reasonable familiarities with him, vpon this accesse of
myracles imputed to him, resolued to request him something in our owne
behalfes. I because I was his suborned Lorde and master, desired him to
see the liuely image of _Geraldine_ his loue in the glasse, and what at
that instant she did, and with whome shee was talking. Hee shewed her
vs without more adoe, sicke weeping on her bedde, and resolued all into
deuoute religion for the absence of her Lorde. At the sight thereof hee
coulde in no wise refrayne, though hee had tooke vppon him the condition
of a seruant, but hee must forthwith frame this extemporall Dittie.

     _All soule, no earthly fleshy why dost thou fade,
     All gold, no worthlesse drosse, why lookst thou pale,
     Sicknesse how darst thou one so faire inuadey
     Too base infirmitie to worke her bale,
     Heauen be distemperd since she grieuedpines,
     Neuer be drie these my sadplaintiue lines.

     Pearch thou my spirit on her siluer breasts,
     And with theirpaine redoubled musike beatings,
     Let them tosse thee to world where all toile rests,
     Where blisse is subiect to nofeares defeatings,
     Her praise I tune whose tongue doth tune the sphears,
     And gets new muses in her hearers eares.

     Starres fall to fetch fresh light from her rich eyes,
     Her bright brow driues the Sunne to clouds beneath,
     Her hair es reflexe with red strokes paints the skies,
     Sweet morne and euening deaw flowes from her breath:
     Phoebe rules tides, she my teares tides forth drawesy
     In her sicke bed hue sits and maketh lawes.

     Her daintie limbes tinsel I her silke soft sheets,
     Her rose-crownd cheekes eclipse my daze led sight,
     O glasse with too much ioy my thoughts thou greets,
     And yet thou shewst me day but by twielight
     Ile kisse thee for the kindnesse I hauefelt,
     Her lips one kisse would vnto Nectar melt._

Though the Emperors court, and the extraordinaire edifieng companie of
_Cornelius Agrippa_ might haue beene arguments of waight to haue arested
vs a little longer there, yet Italy stil stuck as a great moat in my
masters eie, he thought he had trauelled no farther tha Wales til he had
tooke suruey of that Countrie which was such a curious moulder of wits.

To cut off blinde ambages by the high way side, we made a long stride
& got to Venice in short time, where hauing scarce lookt about vs,
a precious supernaturall pandor, apparelled in all points like a
gentleman, and hauing halfe a dosen seuerall languages in his purse,
entertained vs in our owne tongue verie paraphrastically and eloquently,
and maugre all other pretended acquaintance, would haue vs in a violent
kinde of curtesie to be the guests of his appointment. His name was
_Petro de campo Frego_, a notable practitioner in the pollicy of
baudrie. The place whether he brought vs, was a pernicious curtizans
house named _Tabitha_ the Temptresses, a wench that could set as ciuill
a face on it, as chastities first martyr _Lucrecia_. What will you
conceit to bee in anie Saintes house that was there to seeke? Bookes,
pictures, beades, crucifixes, why there was a haberdashers shop of
them in euerie chamber. I warrant you should not see one set of her
neckercher peruerted or turned awrie, not a piece of a haire displast.
On her beddes there was not a wrinkle of anie wallowing to be founde,
her pillowes bare out as smooth as a groning wiues belly, & yet she was
a Turke and an infidell, and had more dooinges than all her neighbours
besides. Us for our money they vsed lyke Emperours, I was master as you
hearde before, and my master the Earle was but as my chiefe man whome I
made my companion. So it happened (as iniquitie will out at one time or
other) that she perceiuing my expence had no more ventes than it should
haue, fell in with my supposed semant my man, and gaue him halfe a
promise of marriage, if he woulde helpe to make me away, that she and he
might inioy the iewels and wealth that I had.

The indifficultie of the condition thus she explaind vnto him, her
house stood vpon vaults, which in two hundred yeeres together were
neuer searcht, who came into her house none tooke notice of, his fellow
seruants that knewe of his masters abode there, should be all dispatcht
by him as from his master, into sundrie partes of the citie about
busines, and when they returned, answere should bee made that hee lay
not there anie more, but had remoued to Padua since their departure, &
thether they must follow him. Now (quoth she) if you be disposed to make
him awaie in their absence, you shall haue my house at command. Stab,
poison, or shoote him through with a pistol all is one, into the vault
he shall be throwen when the deede is done. On my bare honestie it was
a craftie queane, for she had enacted with her selfe if he had bin
my legitimate seruant, as he was one that serued and supplied my
necessities, when hee had murthered me, to haue accused him of the
murther, and made all that I had hers (as I carryed all my masters
wealth, monie, iewels, rings, or bils of exchaunge continually about
me.) He verie subtilly consented to her stratageme at the first motion,
kill me he woulde, that heauens could not withstand, and a pistoll was
the predestinate engin which must deliuer the parting blow. God wot I
was a rawe young squier, and my master dealt iudasly with me, for he
tolde mee but euerie thing that she and he agreed of. Wherfore I
could not possibly preuent it, but as a man woulde saie auoide it. The
execution daie aspired to his vtmost deuolution, into my chamber came
my honourable attendant with his pistoll charged by his side verie
suspitiously and sullenly, lady _Tabitha_ and _Petro de catnpo Frego_
her pandor followed him at the hard heeles. At theyr enterance I saluted
them all verie familiarly and merily, and began to impart vnto them what
disquiet dreames had disturbed me the last night I dreamd, quoth I, that
my man _Brunquell_ heere (for no better name got he of mee) came into my
chamber with a pistoll charged vnder his arme to kill me, and that hee
was suborned by you mistres _Tabitha_, and my verie good friend
here _Petro de campo Frego_. God send it tourne to good, for it hath
afrighted mee aboue measure. As they were readie to enter into a
colourable common place of the deceitful friuolousnes of dreames, my
trustie seruant _Brunquell_ stoode quiuering and quaking euerie ioynt
of him, and (as it was before compacted between vs) let his pistoll drop
from him on the sodain, wherwith I started out of my bed, and drew my
rapier and cride murther, murther, which made good wife _Tabitha_ readie
to bepisse her.

My seruant, or my master, which you will, I tooke roughly by the coller,
and threatned to run him thorough incontinent if he confest not the
truth. He as it were striken with remorse of conscience (God be with
him, for he could counterfeit most daintily) downe on his knees, askt
me forgiuenes, and impeached _Tabitha_ and _Petro de catnpo Frego_ as
guiltie of subornation. I verie mildly and grauely gaue him audience,
raile on them I did not after his tale was ended, but sayd I would trie
what the lawe coulde doe. Conspiracie by the custome of their countrie
was a capitall offence, and what custome or iustice might affoord
they should be all sure to feele. I could (quoth I) acquite my selfe
otherwise, but it is not for a straunger to bee his owne caruer in
reuenge. Not a worde more with _Tabitha_ but die she would before God
or the deuill would haue her, she sounded and reuiued, and then sounded
againe, and after shee reuiued again sighed heauily, spoke faintly
and pittifully, yea and so pittifully, as if a man had not knowen the
prankes of harlots before, he would haue melted in comiseration. Tears,
sighs, and dolefull tuned wordes could not make anie forcible claime
to my stonie eares, it was the glistering crownes that I hungered and
thirsted after, and with them for all her mock holyday iestures she
was faine to come off, before I woulde condiscend to anie bargaine of
silence. So it fortuned (fie vpon that vnfortunate word of Fortune) yt
this whore, this quean, this curtizan, this common of ten thousand, so
bribing me not to bewray her, had giuen me a great deale of counterfeit
gold, which she had receiued of a coiner to make awaie a little before.
Amongst the grosse summe of my briberie, I silly milkesop mistrusting no
deceit, vnder an angell of light tooke what she gaue me, nere turnd it
ouer, for which (O falsehood in faire shew) my master and I had like
to haue bin turned ouer. Hee that is a knight arrant, exercised in the
affaires of Ladies and Gentlewomen, hath more places to send mony to,
than the diuell hath to send his spirites to. There was a delicate wench
called _Flauia Aemilia_ lodging in S. Markes streete at a Goldsmiths,
which I would faine haue had to the grand test, to trie whether she were
currant in alcumie or no. Aie me, shee was but a counterfeit slip, for
she not only gaue me the slip, but had welnie made me a slipstring. To
her I sent my gold to beg an hour of grace, ah gracelesse fornicatresse,
my hostesse & she wer confederate, who hauing gotten but one piece of my
ill golde into their kandes, deuised the meanes to make me immortall.
I could drinke for anger till my head akt, to think how I was abused.
Shall I shame the deuill and speake the truth, to prison was I sent as
principall, and my master as accessarie, nor was it to a prison neither,
but to the master of the mints house who though partly our iudge, and
a most seuere vpright iustice in his own nature, extreamly seemed to
condole our ignorant estate, and without all peraduenture a present
redresse he had ministred, if certaine of our countrie men hearing an
English earle was apprehended for coining, had not come to visite vs. An
ill planet brought them thether, for at the first glance they knew the
seruant of my secrecies to be the Earle of Surrey, and I (not worthie
to be named I) an outcast of his cup or his pantofles. Thence, thence
sprong the full period of our infelicitie. The master of the mint our
whilome refresher and consolation, now tooke part against vs, he thought
we had a mint in our head of mischieuous conspiracies against their
state. Heauens bare witnes with vs it was not so, (Heauens wyll not
always come to witnes when they are cald.)

To a straiter ward were we comitted: that which we haue imputatiuely
transgressed must beaunswered. O the heathen heigh passe, and the
intrinsecall legerdemain of our special approued good pandor _Petro de
Campo Frego_. Hee although he dipt in the same dish with vs euerie daie,
seeming to labor our cause verie importunatly, and had interpreted
for vs to the state from y beginning, yet was one of those trecherous
brother _Trulies_, and abused vs most darkly. He interpreted to vs
with a pestilence, for whereas we stood obstinatly vpon it, we were
wrongfully deteined, and that it was naught but a malicious practise of
sinfull _Tabitha_ our late hostesse, he by a fine conny-catching corrupt
translation, made vs plainely to confesse, and crie _Miserere_, ere we
had need of our neckverse.

Detestable, detestable, that the flesh and the deuill shoulde deale
by their factors. He stand to it, there is not a pandor but hath vowed
paganisme. The deuill himselfe is not such a deuill as he, so be he
performe his function aright. He must haue the backe of an asse, the
snout of an elephant, the wit of a foxe, and the teeth of a wolfe, he
must faune like a spaniell, crouch like a Jew, Here like a sheepbiter.
If he be halfe a puritan, and haue scripture continually in his mouth,
he speeds the better. I can tell you it is a trade of great promotion,
and let none euer thinke to mount by seruice in forain courts, or creep
neere to some magnifique Lords, if they be not seene in this science.
O it is the art of arts, and ten thousand times goes beyond the
intelligencer. None but a staid graue ciuill man is capable of it, he
must haue exquisite courtship in him or else he is not old who, he wants
the best point in his tables.

God be mercifull to our pandor (and that were for God to worke a
miracle) he was seene in all the seuen liberall deadly sciences, not a
sinne but he was as absolute in as sathan himselfe. Sathan could neuer
haue supplanted vs so as hee did. I may saie to you he planted in vs the
first Italionate wit that we had. During the time we lay close and toke
phisick in this castle of contemplation, there was a Magnificos wife
of good calling sent in to beare vs companie. Her husbands name was
_Castaldo_, she hight _Diamante_, the cause of her committing was an
vngrounded ielous suspition which her doating husbande had conceiued of
her chastitie. One _Isaac Medicus_ a bergomast was the man hee chose
to make him a monster, who beeing a courtier and repairing to his house
very often, neither for loue of him nor his wife, but onely with a drift
to borrowe monie of a pawne of waxe and parchment, when he sawe his
expectation deluded, and that _Castaldo_ was too charie for him to
close with, he priuily with purpose of reuenge, gaue out amongest his
copesmates, that hee resorted to _Castaldos_ house for no other end
but to cuckolde him, & doubtfully he talkt that he had and he had not
obtained his sute. Rings which he borrowed of a light curtizan that he
vsed to, hee woulde faine to bee taken from her fingers, and in summe,
so handled the matter, that _Castaldo_ exclaimd, Out whore, strumpet,
sixe penny hackster, away with her to prison.

As glad were we almost as if they had giuen vs libertie, that fortune
lent vs such a sweet puefellow. A pretie round faced wench was it, with
blacke cie browes, a high forehead, a litle mouth, and a sharpe nose, as
fat and plum euerie part of her as a plouer, a skin as slike and soft as
the backe of a swan, it doth me good when I remember her. Like a birde
she tript on the ground, and bare out her belly as maiesticall as
an Estrich. With a licorous rouling eie fixt percing on the earth, &
sometimes scornfully darted on the tone side, she figured foorth a high
discontented disdain, much like a prince puffing and storming at the
treason of some mightie subiect fled lately out of his power. Her verie
countenance repiningly wrathfull, and yet cleere and vnwrinkled, would
haue confirmed the cleernes of her conscience to the austerest iudge
in the world. If in any thing she were culpable, it was in being too
melancholy chast, and shewing her selfe as couetous of her beautie as
her husband was of his bags. Many are honest because they knowe not
how to be dishonest: she thought there was no pleasure in stolne
bread, because there was no pleasure in an olde mans bed. It is almost
impossible that anie woman should be excellently wittie, and not make
the vtmost pennie of her beautie. This age and this countrie of ours
admits of some miraculous exceptions, but former times are my constant
informers. Those that haue quicke motions of wit, haue quicke motions
in euerie thing: yron onely needes many strokes, onely yron wits are not
wonne without a long siege of intreatie. Golde easily bends, the most
ingenious mindes are easiest moued, _Ingenium nobis molle Thalia dedit_,
saith _Psapho_ to _Phao_. Who hath no mercifull milde mistres, I will
maintaine, hath no wittie but a clownish dull flegmatike puppie to his
mistres.

This Magnificos wife was a good louing soule, that had mettall inough
in her to make a good wit of, but being neuer remoued from vnder her
mothers and her husbands wing, it was not moulded and fashioned as it
ought. Causelesse distrust is able to driue deceite into a simple womans
head. I durst pawne the credit of a page, which is worth ams ase at all
times, that she was immaculate honest till she met with vs in prison.
Marie what temptations shee had then when fire and flaxe were put
together, conceit with your selues, but hold my master excusable.

Alacke he was too vertuous to make her vicious, he stoode vpon religion
and conscience, what a hainous thing it was to subuert Gods ordinance.
This was all the iniurie he woulde offer her, sometimes he woulde
imagine her in a melancholic humour to be his _Geraldine_, and court her
in tearmes correspondent, nay he would sweare shee was his _Geraldine_,
& take her white hand and wipe his eyes with it, as though the very
touch of her might stanch his anguish. Now would he kneele and kisse the
ground as holy grounde which she vouchsafed to blesse from barrennesse
by her steps. Who would haue learned to write an excellent passion,
might have bin a perfect tragicke poet, had he but attended halfe the
extremitie of his lament. Passion vpon passion would throng one on
anothers necke, he would praise her beyond the moone and starres, and
that so sweetly & rauishingly, as I perswade myself he was more in loue
with his owne curious forming fancie than her face, and truth it is,
many become passionate louers, only to win praise to theyr wits.
